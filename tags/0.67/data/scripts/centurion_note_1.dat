TALK Edgar There's a note here
TALK Note I've managed to escape from my cell and am trying to find a way out
TALK Note I found a door blocked by a frame which you need to put 9 jigsaw puzzle pieces in
TALK Note The pieces are locked behind doors which seem to be linked to the Red Centurions
TALK Note The Centurions appear to be indestructable however
TALK Note Unless I can find a way to destroy them I will die down here
TALK Edgar I'll find a way to destroy them
TALK Edgar I'm so close to rescuing Dad now...
