TALK Edgar This place is crazy, I'd better hurry up and find Dad before I end up getting killed!
TALK Edgar So, to create that Fire Shield I have to get a Red Sludge tentacle
TALK Edgar Red Sludges live in mines so I'll have to find one around here
TALK Edgar I also need a spare shield, but I reckon there should be an armoury around
TALK Edgar The Gazer eyeballs are easy enough, I can just return to the basement
TALK Edgar OK, off I go...
TALK Narrator You won't be able to get the tentacle or shield in this version, so check back later!
