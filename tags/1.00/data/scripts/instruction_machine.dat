TALK Edgar This machine has a slot the same size as the cards. I guess I can use it to create new instructions.
TALK Narrator To create a new set of instructions you need to insert a blank card
TALK Narrator You will then be prompted to input the directions for the robot to follow. This is done in the same way as the sequence doors
TALK Narrator When you have finished inputting the directions, press Attack
TALK Narrator The robot will then follow the instructions on the card
TALK Narrator If the directions aren't correct you can try again
