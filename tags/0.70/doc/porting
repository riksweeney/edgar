PORTING

Updated: June 2009

In order to successfully port The Legend of Edgar to another platform you will need,

* SDL
* SDL Image
* SDL Mixer
* SDL TTF

There are a few considerations when porting to other platforms,

- The makefile is for *nix systems, but will also compile on Windows automagically. For
  other OSes (Amiga, Mac, PSP) you may need to tailor the makefile to get it to compile.
  
- To create the PAK file you can run "make buildpak" after running "make". This will
  be required if you are building the game from source on non *nix platforms (note that
  make install builds the pak file).
  
When you've successfully ported the game to another platform drop me an email and let me
know. Please DO NOT email me the port without asking permission.

If you encounter any bugs please let me know where you encountered it and most importantly
how to reproduce it!

One final note, there is an editor for the game, but it is shipped as is without support. It
does the job I need it to do and unless it hinders my ability to construct later levels in the
game, I won't be changing it! So please don't flag bugs in the editor.
