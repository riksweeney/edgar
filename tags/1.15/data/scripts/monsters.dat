TALK Edgar A dragon?! Dad told me they were all extinct!
TALK Book For years he wreaked havoc across this land and took thousands of innocent lives, his fiery breath incinerated everything in its path
TALK Book Finally a brave warrior and a group of magicians managed to overwhelm and bind him
TALK Book They sealed the dragon away beneath an old fortress
TALK Book It is believed he is still there
TALK Book Slowly regaining his power until he is strong enough to break free and terrorise the world once again
SET EDGAR FACE RIGHT
TALK Edgar Beneath an old fortress? Maybe they mean this one...
TALK Edgar If that dragon is regaining its power then it must be stopped before it's too late
TALK Edgar But if its breath destroys anything then I won't be able to protect myself

TALK Edgar Grimlore
TALK Book Grimlore is a creature from another dimension. It can be summoned using powerful dark magic
TALK Book The most common reason to summon this beast is to act as a bodyguard
TALK Book There is no known way to kill Grimlore since upon sustaining critical injuries it will simply return to its own dimension
TALK Book But even injuring it is a monumental task. Anyone encountering this creature is advised to escape as quickly as possible
TALK Book Or they will die very quickly

TALK Edgar Tortoise, Master
TALK Book Master Tortoises are frightening beasts. Found in far away lands they possess the ability to change their heads
TALK Book They combine all the abilities of their cousins to breathe fire, create ice and electrify themselves
TALK Book And of course they are also impervious to attacks from matching elements, absorbing the energy to heal themselves
TALK Book But additionally, if they receive too much energy from healing, they evolve and go on the rampage
TALK Book In this state they will smash through any defence and produce Dark Matter which destroys anything it touches
TALK Book However, the shell of a rampaging Master Tortoise is highly magical and is an essential ingredient when creating powerful magics and items

TALK Edgar Splitter

TALK Edgar Centurion, Grey
TALK Book Centurions are magically created creatures, usually dispatched as sentries or guards
TALK Book Though slow moving, their massive size allows them to simply march through any defence
TALK Book Instead of arms, many have huge pile drivers which they use to shake the ground and disorientate threats
TALK Book While Grey Centurions will be used to guard outer perimeters, Red Centurions are known to exist and are used to protect areas of great importance

TALK Edgar Gazer
TALK Book Gazers are flying cycloptic creatures found in various places
TALK Book Their single eye is usually closed and they rely on sonar for movement
TALK Book They use their strong sense of smell to look out for predator and prey alike
TALK Book Gazers attack (and defend themselves) by opening their eye which will dazzle anything looking at it
TALK Book This attack is only effective however if the victim is facing the Gazer
TALK Book A Gazer's eyeball contains magical properties and is a common ingredient in spell preparation

TALK Edgar Sludge, Red
TALK Book Unlike its green cousin, the Red Sludge stays deep underground and rarely, if ever, surfaces
TALK Book Its preferred habitat are dry and mineral rich areas and as a result have been found lurking in areas of mines abandoned by humans
TALK Book They are very wary of humans and will attack on sight, usually vomiting up an acid which takes time to evaporate
TALK Book Smacker, Lesser...
TALK Edgar Great, that's all it says. I don't even know how to tell the difference between a male and female. I'll just to take a chance...
TALK Edgar Besides, what's the worst that could happen?
TALK Edgar I didn't see any Sludges in the mine when I went to get Borgan's coal and even if there were any I can't get back there since my raft sank
TALK Edgar I'll have to find another mine around here...
