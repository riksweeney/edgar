<A NAME="introduction"></A>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>The Legend of Edgar is a platform game, not unlike those found on the Amiga and SNES. Edgar must
battle his way across the world, solving puzzles and defeating powerful enemies to achieve his quest.</P>

<A NAME="requirements"></A>
<H4>Requirements</H4>
<P>The Legend of Edgar requires the following,</P>

Minimum Memory    : 32MB
Harddrive         : 110MB

</PRE>

<P>Most Linux users will find that the required SDL libraries came with their system and are probably already
installed. If not, click the name of the library above to go to the relevant homepage.</P>

<A NAME="installation"></A>
<H4>Installation</H4>
<P>The Legend of Edgar can be installed in two different ways. The first (and easiest) is by using
a binary deb package. The second involves building the game. It is recommended that you install via a deb
if you are able to. You will require the libraries listed in the Requirements section whichever method you
choose. For installation from source you will also require the development packages for those libraries
listed.</P>

<P><B>Installation from deb Package</B></P>
<P>To install from deb simply use your preferred method of installation (eg - via a GUI such as KPackage
or via a terminal). If you wish to install via a terminal you can use the do so by typing
the following (remember to change the filename to match the name of the package you are installing),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">dpkg -i edgar-x.x-x.i686.deb</P>

<P>Provided you have all the required libraries installed the game should install without problems.</P>

<P><B>Installation from source</B></P>
<P>If you choose this method you will need to build the game from source. This will require all the appropriate
development libraries (see Requirements) and some knowledge of building an application using the source code.
Open a terminal and use the following commands to extract, compile and install the game (again remember to change the
filename to match the name of the download),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
tar xzf edgar-x.x-x.tar.gz<BR>
cd edgar-x.x-x<BR>
make<BR>
make install<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">*</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><I>* - You will have to be root in order to perform this step.</I></P>

<A NAME="keyboard"></A>
<H4>Keyboard Configuration</H4>
<P>To change the controls select Configure Controls from the Options menu.</P>
<P>The currently configured button will be displayed to the right of the action. To configure an
action highlight the action you wish to set (using the arrow keys on the keyboard) and then press Return.
The current button configuration entry will become a '?' and allow you to press the new key you wish
to use. After doing so the new button will then be displayed.</P>
<P>Repeat this process until you have configured all the keys you wish to. Key configuration is
saved to a file called config in ~/.parallelrealities/edgar/. Configuration is saved only
once and not on a save game basis.</P>

<A NAME="joypad"></A>
<H4>Joypad Configuration</H4>
<P>Joypad configuration is done in the same manner as configuring the keyboard. If you have an analogue joystick
you can use the first analogue stick to move Edgar, so if you have a PlayStation 2 compatible joypad then this will
be the left analogue stick. You can also set the "deadzone" of the analogue stick to make it more or less
sensitive to movement.</P>

otherwise a game will start.</P>

<H4>About</H4>

<P>Parallel Realities started off writing games on the Amiga using AMOS and then, later, Blitz Basic
2. Games written included the BOTSS Trilogy and most notably TANX Squadron. TANX Squadron was awarded
Amiga Format's contributor prize of the month in the summer of 1999. Project: Starfighter was Parallel
Realities' first contribution to the Linux gaming scene and was well recieved when it was released in
2001. This was followed in 2003 with the release of Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid and its sequel, Blob
and Conquer, in 2008.</P>

<P>The Legend of Edgar is our fifth contribution to Linux and we hope you enjoy it as much
as Project: Starfighter and the Blob Wars saga.</P>
