PORTING

Updated: January 2013

In order to successfully port The Legend of Edgar to another platform you will need,

* SDL
* SDL Image
* SDL Mixer
* SDL TTF
* zlib
* GNU gettext

There are a few considerations when porting to other platforms:

- The makefile is for *nix systems, but will also compile on Windows automagically. For
  other OSes (Amiga, Mac, PSP) you may need to tailor the makefile to get it to compile.

- To create the PAK file you can run "make buildpak" after running "make". This will
  be required if you are building the game from source on non *nix platforms (note that
  make install builds the pak file).

- The game supports GNU gettext files. These files must be installed to

  /usr/share/locale/<country code>/LC_MESSAGES/edgar.mo (for *nix systems)
  <edgar install dir>/locale/<country code>/LC_MESSAGES/edgar.mo (for other systems)

  You should be able to compile the included po files by issuing

  msgfmt -c -o edgar.mo <country code>.po

  and then copying the resultant file to the appropriate directly as described above.

If you encounter any bugs please let me know where you encountered it and most importantly
how to reproduce it!

One final note: there is an editor for the game, but it is shipped as is without support.
