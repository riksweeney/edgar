TALK Edgar This place is crazy, I'd better hurry up and find Dad before I end up getting killed!
TALK Edgar So, to create that Fire Shield I have to get a Red Sludge tentacle
TALK Edgar Red Sludges live in mines so I'll have to find one around here
TALK Edgar I also need a spare shield, but I reckon there should be an Armoury around
TALK Edgar The Gazer eyeballs are easy enough, I can just return to the Basement
TALK Edgar OK, off I go...
