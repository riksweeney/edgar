TALK Edgar Hey wow, what a cute little machine!
TALK Edgar It's got a little slot on the back of it. I guess I put something in there to make it do stuff
TALK Narrator The robot uses instruction cards to move around
TALK Narrator Use the instructions to guide the robot to open areas that you cannot access
TALK Narrator However, since you can't read the instructions on the card, you will have to try them all out until one works
TALK Narrator If the robot doesn't reach its target, then it will return to its starting position allowing you to try again
