Translating
-----------

If you want to translate The Legend of Edgar into another language, you will need to use the
"edgar.pot" file which is in the locale directory.

If you have used GNU Gettext then you should be quite familiar with the process. Unfortunately I don't
have any experience with it so I cannot offer any assistance.

Most of the text in the scripts and item names have been translated

You can attach the po files to the SourceForge tracker
