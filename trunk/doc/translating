Translating
-----------

If you want to help with translating the game into another language, you can do so by downloading the edgar.pot file from

http://legendofedgar.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/legendofedgar/trunk/locale/edgar.pot

and use it to translate the game.

Alternatively, you can log into Launchpad

https://translations.launchpad.net/edgar

You will need to create an account to do it this way.

You will need knowledge of gettext, which you can read up about here

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Gettext

There are two partial translations present in the game, Polish and Spanish, though fairly out of date
now, serve as a good starting point.
