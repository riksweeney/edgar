Translating
-----------

If you want to translate The Legend of Edgar into another language, you will need to download the
source code as this has the "messages.po" file in it.

If you have used GNU Gettext then you should be quite familiar with the process. Unfortunately I don't
have any experience with it so I cannot offer any assistance.

If the game has any untranslatable strings then let me know.

Finally, just remember that while you are translating the game you might run into secrets or spoilers so
if you don't want your enjoyment of the game ruined then it may be best to leave the translating until later!

You can send the .po files to the address below
