msgid "Hello Edgar"
msgstr ""

msgid "Can I borrow your shield?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Off to practice your fighting skills?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something like that"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you run me an errand then you can have the shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do I have to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the mine and collect me some coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "But we have plenty of coal!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, but this is not any old coal, this coal is special, it burns hotter and lasts longer"
msgstr ""

msgid "I only need 10 pieces of the stuff, so it shouldn't take you very long"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure you put it in a bag, touching it for too long will be bad for your health"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have a bag?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No, you can probably find one in the mine though"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, I'll get the coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, take this pickaxe. You can use it to mine the coal and hack through any weaker walls you encounter"
msgstr ""

msgid "You'll also need this key to get into the mine"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you, Edgar, this coal is perfect! Hope the bats didn't scare you."
msgstr ""

msgid "The bats were the least of my worries..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Say, I heard that something happened in that mine a few years ago"
msgstr ""

msgid "Right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, have my shield and have fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Just stay away from the Forbidden Swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Will do, can I hold on to your pickaxe for a while?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sure thing, just bring it back in one piece"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks, Borgan!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you managed to find the coal yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can pull some items around by pushing against them whilst holding down the Action button."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then pull it around until you let go of the Action button"
msgstr ""

msgid "This rock looks too strong for my pickaxe. I'll have to use something else to get through..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Urgh, what happened?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like this wasn't such a good idea after all"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be way out of here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think my shield will protect me from those fireballs. I'll have to find a stronger one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Strange creature..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, what was that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You again?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something is supposed to happen here, but it's not in this version so check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Edgar! My chickens are back and these logs will do me fine"
msgstr ""

msgid "Take this sword, may it serve you well!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks for the logs, have you had any luck with the chickens?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll give you a sword if you get me 2 chopped logs from the forest and rescue at least 3 of my chickens"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello Edgar, what can I do for you today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have a sword I can borrow?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I do have a sword and you can have it if you do something for me first"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK... what do I have to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of my chickens have escaped from their pen and I would be very grateful if you can get them back for me"
msgstr ""

msgid "I have set up some traps near their pen, you can lure them to the traps using this chicken feed. I don't need them all, but at least 3 would be very helpful. I can get the rest myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not quite. Can you also get me some wood from the forest? 2 logs should be sufficient"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have an axe?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Erm... I left my axe in the forest somewhere. It should still be there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn't that forest dangerous?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not really, if anything gets in your way, just hit it with a weapon"
msgstr ""

msgid "Such as an axe?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, that would do the trick"
msgstr ""

msgid "..."
msgstr ""

msgid "But seriously, there's nothing in there that can really harm you. That problem was dealt with a long time ago..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, thanks Edgar, I only needed 3, but thanks for the additional help!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, Maggie made me this health potion but I don't need it so why don't you have it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Jacob"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, you caught them all, thanks alot!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, I have these for you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maggie made me this health potion but you can have it"
msgstr ""

msgid "And this is something very special"
msgstr ""

msgid "May this help you on your way to becoming a strong warrior"
msgstr ""

msgid "You saved me a lot of time. Maggie made me something else but since you have been so helpful, you can have it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hi Maggie"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Maggie!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be something around here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drat, the drawbridge is up. There must be another entrance..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I could tunnel my way in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "These machines aren't working."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like a gem should fit in this hole, maybe I can find some replacements."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like it's tightly wedged in there. I can probably loosen it with the pickaxe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "To get to the Forbidden Swamp I'll need to build a raft."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can build the raft if I chop down enough trees from the forest"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need 6 Chopped Logs to build a raft"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not going to the swamp without a sword and shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aw, not again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This had better be the last time I have to do this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "That was easy! And I can always get back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh...."
msgstr ""

msgid "Guess I have no choice now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hang on Dad, I'm coming..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've been trapped down here for what seems like an eternity"
msgstr ""

msgid "To get out of this place I need 3 Access Keys to work the lifts"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far I have only found 1"
msgstr ""

msgid "To make matters worse, I can only reach some switches with a carefully placed arrow"
msgstr ""

msgid "But spares aren't common and I have run out"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I don't find a way out of here soon, I fear I may starve"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I don't get out of here I'll suffer the same fate..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, what's this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here too"
msgstr ""

msgid "The potion is perfect! Quaffing it will turn a human into a creature for a small amount of time"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far I can only transmogrify myself into one creature but with a bit more time anything should be possible"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a tiny bit left, it should be safe to drink"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Urgh!! This is horrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Borgan told me that Slimes can swim in water though, so maybe this will be useful..."
msgstr ""

msgid "When transformed into a Slime, you can move around as normal. You can also swim in the water and use up and down to move around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pushing up or jump will make you jump out of the water if you're near the surface"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep an eye on the timer at the bottom of the screen. When it reaches 0 you will automatically become human again"
msgstr ""

msgid "This place doesn't look so bad..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What was that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Uh Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phew, I'm glad to be out of there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to get through this swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, what's this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks pretty harmless, I'll try stepping on it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow! That was cool! This must be a mechanical teleporter."
msgstr ""

msgid "I wonder if it works both ways..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not only is this going to save me a lot of walking, it's also loads of fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now try out your shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Block the pellets spat out by the plant and jump up to the next ledge"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some items in the game can be pushed and pulled"
msgstr ""

msgid "To push an item, simply walk into it"
msgstr ""

msgid "To pull an item, walk into while holding down Action"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then pull the item around until you let go of Action"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pull the box over the other side and use it to reach the ledge"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the last part of the tutorial and will teach you to block and attack enemies"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, you should equip the sword since it has more range and does more damage than the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgid "Occasionally, slain enemies will drop health which will vanish after a few seconds, so pick it up quickly!"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a bat is getting too close to you, hold block and it will harmlessly bounce off you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now kill all of the bats in the area!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two types of door in the game. Manual doors and Automatic doors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual doors require keys to open them, Automatic doors require switches."
msgstr ""

msgid "To open a locked door that you have the key for, simply walk into it. There is no need to have the key selected in your inventory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open the door and continue to the right"
msgstr ""

msgid "Congratulations! Now you know the basics of playing you should try the main game"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you want to replay this tutorial, press Escape and select Tutorial from the menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "To play the main game, press Escape and select New Game from the menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the tutorial for The Legend of Edgar. This tutorial will explain how to play the game."
msgstr ""

msgid "To exit this tutorial, press Escape and use the Up and Down arrow keys to choose an option. Press Return to select it."
msgstr ""

msgid "To pick up an item, simply walk into it. Any collectable items will be added to your inventory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Whilst in the inventory, use the arrow keys to view the items."
msgstr ""

msgid "Walk over the key to pick it up"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can change all of the controls in the game by pressing Escape and selecting Options in the menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "Select Configure Controls using the arrow keys and press Return"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use the arrow keys to select the control you want to change and press Return."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, press the key that you want to use instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Regardless of what keys you choose, you can always navigate the menus using the arrow keys and Return"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you have finished configuring the keys, go right to the next Action Point"
msgstr ""

msgid "The pickaxe is one of many weapons you will encounter in the game"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use it as both a weapon and a tool"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pick up the pickaxe and continue to the next Action Point"
msgstr ""

msgid "Congratulations, you found a secret!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are many secrets in the main game so keep a look out for them"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's a hint to get you started"
msgstr ""

msgid "The shield will protect you from most enemy attacks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some enemy attacks cannot be blocked"
msgstr ""

msgid "Environmental hazards, such as falling rocks, cannot be blocked"
msgstr ""

msgid "You must be facing the attack to successfully block it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that you cannot move whilst blocking, but you can face the other way. You also cannot block in the air"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pick up the shield and continue to the right"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a weak wall, it can be smashed down using the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgid "Destroy the wall using the pickaxe and continue"
msgstr ""

msgid "Collect 10 pieces of Coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "Collect 2 Chopped Logs"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rescue 3 Chickens"
msgstr ""

msgid "A potion which renders you invisible to certain enemies"
msgstr ""

msgid "The eyeball from a Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Tesla Pack. It has no charge."

msgstr ""

msgid "No Objectives"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Action to reset puzzle blocks"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need a Red Sludge Tentacle and 3 Gazer Eyeballs to make the potion "
msgstr ""

msgid "I still need an Empty Bottle to put the potion in"
msgstr ""

msgid "So this is the Fortress."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like a lot of doors lead off to other areas, I should have a proper look around before I go anywhere else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Try hitting the skull..."

msgid "This machine is not active"

msgid "Repeat the sequence"

msgid "The Legend of Edgar has encountered the following error"
msgstr ""

msgid "Please report this error to Parallel Realities"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like a blender. I could use this to liquidise something"
msgstr ""

msgid "This must be the coal Borgan wants me to mine for him"
msgstr ""

msgid "That might explain why that lift wasn't working. Defeating the other drainers should restore the power here."
msgstr ""

msgid "I need to find 3 Gazer Eyes, 1 Red Sludge Tentacle and an extra shield to create a Shield of Fire Resistance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Once I've found all these items I'll have to find a place to create the shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I can create a shield..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Swords... Armour... Wands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stupid book. It's not in order and there's no index"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here we go: Shields"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shield of Fire Resistance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ingredients"
msgstr ""

msgid "One must gather the following"
msgstr ""

msgid "The root of a Mandrake"
msgstr ""

msgid "The fat of a Darsh (left to stand for 3 months)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Powered Condor bones"
msgstr ""

msgid "3 eyes of the Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "The freshly cut tentacle from a female Red Sludge"
msgstr ""

msgid "The shield to apply the enchantment"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend the Gazer eyes and Sludge tentacle into a smooth liquid"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add the root, fat and bones into the cauldron and mix together with the blended Gazer eyes and Sludge tentacle"
msgstr ""

msgid "When the mixture turns bright blue, add the shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "And the Gazers hang around in the basement so that's not a problem"
msgstr ""

msgid "What I do need to find is a Red Sludge, but I have no idea where to find one"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't use my current shield in the experiment in case it backfires so I'll have to find another one"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There might be potions room or lab where I can find the roots, fat and bones so I don't need to worry about those"
msgstr ""

msgid "You must have the instruction card you wish to use highlighted in your inventory box"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, a laboratory!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I love watching Maggie make spells and potions, maybe I can make some of my own here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, I've never seen so many books in one place!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be information about every subject here, this could be useful..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm, the air feels charged, it reminds me of Maggie's house when she was making spells. I should be careful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh Edgar, you're hurt! Let me heal your wounds"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gazers are flying cycloptic creatures found in various places"
msgstr ""

msgid "Their single eye is usually closed and they rely on sonar for movement"
msgstr ""

msgid "They use their strong sense of smell to look out for predator and prey alike"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gazers attack (and defend themselves) by opening their eye which will dazzle anything looking at it"
msgstr ""

msgid "This attack is only effective however if the victim is facing the Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Gazer's eyeball contains magical properties and is a common ingredient in spell preparation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Centurion, Grey"
msgstr ""

msgid "Centurions are magically created creatures, usually dispatched as sentries or guards"
msgstr ""

msgid "Though slow moving, their massive size allows them to simply march through any defence"
msgstr ""

msgid "Instead of arms, many have huge pile drivers which they use to shake the ground and disorientate threats"
msgstr ""

msgid "While Grey Centurions will be used to guard outer perimeters, Red Centurions are known to exist and are used to protect areas of great importance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Splitter"
msgstr ""

msgid "Splitters are harmless monsters unless attacked."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upon sustaining too much damage they will split in two and attack their predator"
msgstr ""

msgid "If all its parts are still alive, a splitter will reform itself after a while and heal its wounds"
msgstr ""

msgid "Grub, Red"
msgstr ""

msgid "Red Grubs are more aggressive than their green counterparts and will attack anything they view as a threat"
msgstr ""

msgid "Upon reaching maturity they will form a cocoon and morph into a wasp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some however will morph into a queen wasp. These queens can produce a mucus-like substance capable of holding its prey in place"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tortoise, Master"
msgstr ""

msgid "Master Tortoises are frightening beasts. Found in far away lands they possess the ability to change their heads"
msgstr ""

msgid "They combine all the abilities of their cousins to breathe fire, create ice and electrify themselves"
msgstr ""

msgid "And of course they are also impervious to attacks from matching elements, absorbing the energy to heal themselves"
msgstr ""

msgid "But additionally, if they receive too much energy from healing, they evolve and go on the rampage"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this state they will smash through any defence and produce Dark Matter which destroys anything it touches"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, the shell of a rampaging Master Tortoise is highly magical and is an essential ingredient when creating powerful magics and items"
msgstr ""

msgid "Venus Flytrap"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hoover, Pink"
msgstr ""

msgid "Summoner, Dark"
msgstr ""

msgid "Grimlore"
msgstr ""

msgid "Grimlore is a creature from another dimension. It can be summoned using powerful dark magic"
msgstr ""

msgid "The most common reason to summon this beast is to act as a bodyguard"
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no known way to kill Grimlore since upon sustaining critical injuries it will simply return to its own dimension"
msgstr ""

msgid "But even injuring it is a monumental task. Anyone encountering this creature is advised to escape as quickly as possible"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or they will die very quickly"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ah, here is a compendium of monsters"
msgstr ""

msgid "34 volumes! How can there be so many monsters in the world?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like they're in alphabetical order though"
msgstr ""

msgid "Slime, Green... Slime, Purple... Sludge, Green..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sludge, Red"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike its green cousin, the Red Sludge stays deep underground and rarely, if ever, surfaces"
msgstr ""

msgid "Its preferred habitat are dry and mineral rich areas and as a result have been found lurking in areas of mines abandoned by humans"
msgstr ""

msgid "They are very wary of humans and will attack on sight, usually vomiting up an acid which takes time to evaporate"
msgstr ""

msgid "Smacker, Lesser..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Great, that's all it says. I don't even know how to tell the difference between a male and female. I'll just to take a chance..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Although Jacob only requires you to catch 3 of his chickens, why not be nice to him and catch more? There are 10 wandering the map in all"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that not all weak walls can be destroyed using the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've already checked, he's not down there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I've heard of people falling into the well before, maybe Dad's in there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "DAD!!!!! ARE YOU DOWN THERE?!!!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing. I guess I'll have to keep on looking"
msgstr ""

msgid "Push Up or Down to raise or lower the platform"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a book here about enchanting equipment"
msgstr ""

msgid "Just like regular Summoners, Dark Summoners call in other beasts to do their bidding"

msgid "Additionally though they can teleport short distances to escape from their opponents"
msgstr ""

msgid "Their staff is highly magical and although it cannot be used by humans directly, its magical properties are used in spell creation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pink Hoovers are small quadrupeds with a long snout"
msgstr ""

msgid "The primary purpose of the snout is to forage for food but it also serves as a defence mechanism"

msgid "Venus Flytrap, mobile"

msgstr ""

msgid "The robot uses instruction cards to move around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use the instructions to guide the robot to open areas that you cannot access"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, since you can't read the instructions on the card, you will have to try them all out until one works"

msgid "Enter the directions"

msgid "Be sure to reset the lift to avoid a long walk back to the surface..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This machine has a slot the same size as the cards. I guess I can use it to create new instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a new set of instructions you need to insert a blank card"

msgid "You will then be prompted to input the directions for the robot to follow. This is done in the same way as the sequence doors"

msgid "Ah, here it is!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This generator looks OK, it just isn't on"

msgid "Because it is in this version you won't be able to leave"
msgstr ""

msgid "You will now be transported outside"
msgstr ""

msgid "We apologize for the inconvenience"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's a lot of slime"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think the Ice Spray will get across this since it only works on water"
msgstr ""

msgid "Slimes can only swim in water so that's not going to help either"
msgstr ""

msgid "I remember Borgan telling me how ironic that is"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll have to find something to help me get across..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There, the rope's firmly attached"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need to find some rope before I can fire it"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a Grappling Hook"
msgstr ""

msgid "I could probably use it to form a bridge to the other side, but there's no rope"

msgid "I still need a Fire Shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, this place is empty!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I guess the sorceror has no need for weapons since he has magic"

msgid "Great, a spare shield!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This doesn't look like a Fire Shield to me. I was really hoping to find one here too"
msgstr ""

msgid "This shield doesn't even look any better than my current one."
msgstr ""

msgid "I just need to create the liquid from the Sludge tentacle and Gazer eyeballs"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's not a good sign..."

msgid "I just need to find another shield to enchant..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, a lightning sword!"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks a lot more powerful than my current sword too"
msgstr ""

msgid "With this I should be almost unstoppable"
msgstr ""

msgid "Almost"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Lightning Sword has a limited number of charges and will lose its power when these charges are used up"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enemies will randomly drop more charges when they are killed"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that if the sword completely loses its power it will revert to a regular sword with very little power until you can find more charges"
msgstr ""

msgid "This centurion has no power"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's connected to this treadmill so I could probably charge it up with enough speed"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "I'll have no problem walking over this rope either, thanks to my tightrope walking skills"
msgstr ""

msgid "And Dad said it'd never come in handy!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need a length of rope to attach to the bolt"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a giant crossbow"
msgstr ""

msgid "I could probably use it to create a bridge over those spikes"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll need some rope first though"
msgstr ""

msgid "There, that's the hinges oiled. This should be as good as new now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The hinges are rusted, I'll need to find some oil before I can use it"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't run in this armour, though"
msgstr ""

msgid "Plus, I'm tired from all this walking, jumping, fighting, swimming..."
msgstr ""

msgid "He looks just like me"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Who are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Me? I'm you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "No you're not, where did you come from?"
msgstr ""

msgid "When your stupid experiment failed, part of your conscious separated and created me"

msgid "I'm like you in every way, just more evil"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not evil!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes you are, you know that little part of you that enjoyed pulling the legs off insects?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, I don't do that anymore!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh sure, what about the [GAME_KILLS] creatures that you killed?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That was self defence!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Did you try talking to them?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You're crazy!"
msgstr ""

msgid "No, I'm evil!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's my shield! I need to it rescue my Dad!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well it's mine now"
msgstr ""

msgid "Give it back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fine, I will!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Loser"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll collect his corpse later. The equipment in the lab should be enough for me to carry out my plan..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stupid thing. Maggie makes it all look so easy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, that's the Gazer Eyeball and Tentacle added"
msgstr ""

msgid "And the rest of the ingredients too"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aha! It's gone blue, just like the book said it would"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to add the shield"

msgid "Uh-Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Used Amulet of Resurrection"

msgid "You got into the machine by yourself?! You're even stupider than I thought you were!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm better than you in every single way..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get down from there!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gotcha!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Stupid duds..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Die!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Arghh! My eyes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ha ha ha!!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Soon we will be one again..."

msgid "OH NO! THIS IS THE WRONG MACHINE!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "ARGHHHHHH!!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Phew, I feel whole again"
msgstr ""

msgid "And there's my Fire Shield!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully this will get me past all those fireballs..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here goes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Glad to be out of there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to get that shield back from my double..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I've seen this type of metal before, it heats up really easily"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I can find a way to melt it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Found you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "You survived?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "You sound surprised, I thought you'd have known considering we're the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "Except you're evil"
msgstr ""

msgid "More evil"
msgstr ""

msgid "Whatever, now I..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What is all this stuff?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your experiment separated part of your conscious"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes I know that, you already told me"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm still talking!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There should only be one of us in this world: one body, one conscious"
msgstr ""

msgid "These machines will join us together"
msgstr ""

msgid "The one on the left is for the original body, you"
msgstr ""

msgid "And the one on the right is for the new body, me"
msgstr ""

msgid "You will go in the one on the left and I'll go in the one on the right"
msgstr ""

msgid "It will then merge your body into mine, leaving just me"
msgstr ""

msgid "Merge us together? Over my dead body!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That was the plan. Since you're alive though, you've saved me the bother of having to drag your carcass all the way back here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now get in the machine!"
msgstr ""

msgid "A spanner"
msgstr ""

msgid "An exploding Gazer Eyeball. A dud?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatically brings you back to life once if you die"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flaming Arrows"

msgid "A shield that can resist fire"
msgstr ""

msgid "Solve the jigsaw puzzle"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try luring something else into the Ant Lion's pit..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Those flames are incredibly hot. I'll be burnt to cinders if I try and walk through them"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be a way to cool them down..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I've found a way to kill the Centurions"
msgstr ""

msgid "They will reform unless one of their parts falls into the slime or lava"
msgstr ""

msgid "I managed to retrieve two of the puzzle pieces before I was caught and locked in here again"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I can break out of here again I'll be sure to escape"
msgstr ""

msgid "Otherwise I hope another unfortunate victim will find this information useful"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a skull here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like he didn't manage to get out..."
msgstr ""

msgid "If one of these sustains too much damage it will split once again"
msgstr ""

msgid "These versions are completely harmless and in this state can be simply stepped on"
msgstr ""

msgid "This might have come in handy when I was hunting for the Red Sludges"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, there might be something else in these books worth reading..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, we meet at last!"
msgstr ""

msgid "My name is Edgar and I have spent the last [HOURS] hours trying to find you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fascinating. What do you want?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've come to rescue my father, tell me where he is!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your father? My dear child, I do not have the foggiest idea what you are talking about"
msgstr ""

msgid "But if he's anywhere, he'll be in my dungeon. Why don't you look there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've managed to escape from my cell and am trying to find a way out"
msgstr ""

msgid "I found a door blocked by a frame which you need to put 9 jigsaw puzzle pieces in"
msgstr ""

msgid "The pieces are locked behind doors which seem to be linked to the Red Centurions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Centurions appear to be indestructible however"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unless I can find a way to destroy them I will die down here"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll find a way to destroy them"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm so close to rescuing Dad now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Find 9 Puzzle Pieces"
msgstr ""

msgid "A jigsaw puzzle?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not really a fan of these"
msgstr ""

msgid "I prefer the sliding puzzles, like the one I had to solve to get the Lightning Sword"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, it looks like this is the only way out"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like I need 9 pieces to slot into the frame"
msgstr ""

msgid "The frame is empty"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully the pieces I need are around somewhere, otherwise I'm going to die down here"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've got all the pieces, I just need to place them in the frame and solve the puzzle"
msgstr ""

msgid "Push left, right, up or down to move the cursor"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Attack to select the current piece and move it around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Attack again to stop moving the current piece"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Action to quit the puzzle"

msgid "Ugh, I'm getting really fed up of waking up in strange places with my eyes spinning around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, I'm trapped!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be a way to get this door open"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, perhaps that button unlocks it"
msgstr ""

msgid "If only I could reach it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I thought I felt something. There's a draft here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is this what I think it is?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is! It's an Amulet of Resurrection!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Borgan has one of these, but it's been used up. He must have had a lucky escape from something."
msgstr ""

msgid "This should make my quest a lot easier"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Amulet of Resurrection will restore all your health once when it drops to 0"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, it will not save you from anything that causes instant death, such as lava or certain boss attacks"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need all 9 puzzle pieces"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using an item you have picked up is simple"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try it with the bomb, but make sure you stand well back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "While you are in the inventory screen, the action is paused so you can take your time"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some items, such as health potions and weapons can be used in the inventory screen, so there is no need to exit the inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "A piece of a puzzle"
msgstr ""

msgid "The glass looks very weak now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Escape to exit"
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "ESCAPEE LOCATED"
msgstr ""

msgid "TARGET IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS"
msgstr ""

msgid "COMMENCING DESTRUCTION OF TARGET"
msgstr ""

msgid "So you're back? Well this time, only one of us is getting out of here alive!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, what a nice ring"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hang on a second, Maggie told me to always ask if someone had lost something before taking it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "ANYONE LOST A RING?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "No one? Guess it's mine then!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm back in the Fortress, thank goodness for that"
msgstr ""

msgid "But Dad wasn't in there, I looked everywhere and there was no sign of him"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sorceror must have done something else with him, I'll have to go back and find out"
msgstr ""

msgid "A beautiful ring"
msgstr ""

msgid "A power cell from a Gold Centurion"
msgstr ""

msgid "Normal Arrow is required"
msgstr ""

msgid "Created %d Flaming Arrows"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press buttons to escape the snowball!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you managed to find the horn yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you found everything yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not yet, I'm still looking"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, I've found everything now"
msgstr ""

msgid "ARGHHHHH!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Another human, out here? How did you get out here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not sure, I think the sorceror sent me here, but he said he was going to kill me"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm, what's that on your hand?"
msgstr ""

msgid "This? This is just a ring I found in his fortress"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like a ring of protection, it must have saved you. Why were you in his fortress?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He's kidnapped my Dad and I was there trying to save him"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, it looks like the ring's power is almost completely gone"
msgstr ""

msgid "If he hits you with that spell again it will almost certainly kill you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something must have protected you from the spell. Were you wearing a pendant or a ring?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I did find a ring in the fortress but it didn't seem to have any powers"
msgstr ""

msgid "It might have been a ring of protection. I imagine that the protection would have been limited to a single use"
msgstr ""

msgid "What you could do though is combine the ring and your shield together to create a shield that will protect you from the spell"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have any experience mixing spells?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Kind of, but the last time I tried creating a shield the spell backfired and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It created an evil version of yourself?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yeah, how did you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where I'm from it used to happen at least once a month"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why are you here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sorceror caught me looting his fortress and he banished me here"
msgstr ""

msgid "What did you steal?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It was a small golden statue, probably worth a lot of money"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've been here for months now, but I've almost got all the ingredients I need to teleport back home"
msgstr ""

msgid "I just need one more thing, but it's in a cave to the west and I have no weapons to protect myself"
msgstr ""

msgid "But now you're here you can help me retrieve it"
msgstr ""

msgid "I haven't gotten all my stuff back yet. I think everything's here though"
msgstr ""

msgid "When I've found everything I'll come back"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do you need?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's the horn from a particular type of monster"
msgstr ""

msgid "There should be plenty of bones littered around so you shouldn't have to find one and kill it. Just get the horn and get out"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, my stock of logs is looking quite low, maybe you could get me some more while you're out?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Don't even think about it, I'm fed up of chopping down trees and collecting logs!"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, it was just a suggestion"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, you'll need this too"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dip your arrows into it to turn them into fire arrows, it will help you burn down the vines blocking the entrance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, one last thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Seriously, just get the horn"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have I just sent a young boy to his death?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sorry, did you say something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh?! Oh no, I was just practising the teleportation incantation..."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, you escaped"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes I did, and my father wasn't there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe you just didn't look hard enough"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have another look"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe you should work on your spells"
msgstr ""

msgid "NOW TELL ME WHERE MY FATHER IS!"
msgstr ""

msgid "You annoying little brat"
msgstr ""

msgid "I wouldn't be surprised if your father has abandoned you"
msgstr ""

msgid "What?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll show you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That, was a mistake"
msgstr ""

msgid "Die"
msgstr ""

msgid "That was odd, he was supposed to explode"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where did he go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use left and right to move the dial 1 unit at a time"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure you keep count of how many times you move the dial since no on-screen notification is given"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you think you've entered the combination correctly, press Attack to try and open the door"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's no way I'll be able to figure out the combination, I'll have to find out what it is"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks too thick to break open, I'll have to open it using the combination"
msgstr ""

msgid "The lab probably has the roots, fat and bones so I don't need to worry about those"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmm, I've looked everywhere and this appears to be everything"
msgstr ""

msgid "I guess the other things must have been destroyed when the sorceror used that spell"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to find out where I am and how I can get back"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I can..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This book is different to the rest"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can feel a powerful magic emanating from it"
msgstr ""

msgid "A powerful evil magic"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I should leave it alone"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, I could be wrong, maybe it's not evil magic..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What just happened?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I shouldn't go around touching books that give off an evil aura"
msgstr ""

msgid "And spend more time looking for my Dad"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll leave it alone, I'm not getting a good feeling from it"
msgstr ""

msgid "To turn your normal arrows into flaming arrows, just use the flaming arrow potion in the inventory screen"
msgstr ""

msgid "To swap between firing normal arrows and flaming arrows, select the arrows in the inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Retrieve horn"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ouch, my head..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, I've lost all my equipment!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of my stuff is over there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "If those items are in this wasteland then perhaps everything else is too"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll have to try and retrieve as much as I can..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Retrieve items"
msgstr ""

msgid "A potion to create flaming arrows"
msgstr ""

msgid "An Armadillo Spike Ball. Scatters spikes when thrown"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try getting the Borer to grab a bomb..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examine the book?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Turn on the generator?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That monster encyclopedia said the dragon's breath incinerated everything, but that warrior still managed to defeat it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe this book has information about creating a shield to resist dragon breath"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shield of Dragon Fire Resistance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Creation of shields of dragon fire resistance require occult magics and very little is known about their manufacture"
msgstr ""

msgid "Drat, that's all it says"
msgstr ""

msgid "This library is huge though, there must be a book in this place that describes the process"
msgstr ""

msgid "But I've looked everywhere, haven't I?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need to recover my missing items before I can leave"
msgstr ""

msgid "That stuff looks dangerous, it'd probably eat through my armour in seconds"
msgstr ""

msgid "But I'll have to find a way across..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, those look familiar"
msgstr ""

msgid "They look like hypnotic spores"
msgstr ""

msgid "Borgan told me that they can temporarily trick certain creatures into thinking that you're not a threat and leave you alone"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe they'll work on the creatures here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spores that will make certain monsters temporarily harmless"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's out of apples..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Failed"
msgstr ""

msgid "Select a colour for every peg in the row"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Action to retrieve the Horn"
msgstr ""

msgid "Attempts remaining: %d"
msgstr ""

msgid "The pot is empty"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your %s has been stolen!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<Empty>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enabling cheats will not allow you to achieve 100% completion in the game"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks, this is perfect!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have everything you need now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I sure do"
msgstr ""

msgid "So what happens now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can get out of here! Where do you want to go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Back to the fortress, I still need to rescue my Dad from the sorceror"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, remember what I told you about his disintegration spell?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I think so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the lab and combine that ring and your shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "How?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Throw the shield and ring into the cauldron along with some mandrake root, that should do it"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing will go wrong this time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "(I have the statue that Olaf stole)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Perhaps I should return it to him, he is saving me after all)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Then again, he did steal it, and I nearly died trying to get it)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Give the statue to Olaf?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I found this in the cave, is it the statue you took?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes it is! Thanks for finding it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I should be able to sell this for a decent price at the market"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ready to go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return to the Fortress?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not yet, there's something else I need to do"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, let me know when you're ready"
msgstr ""

msgid "Don't hang around in that cave, the monsters that live in there are like nothing you'll have ever encountered before"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, let's go"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes nothing, good luck finding your father"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks, Olaf"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like the pulley for the drawbridge"
msgstr ""

msgid "The mechanism seems to be locked tight"
msgstr ""

msgid "It doesn't look too sturdy though, perhaps I can simply smash it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oops..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe nobody heard that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, the drawbridge is down at any rate..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Got it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What a ridiculous amount of effort to go through just to get a statue..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What was that?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'd better get out of here and get back to the Fortress..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's available on iBooks and the Amazon Kindle"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not exactly sure what any of that means, but it sounds interesting"
msgstr ""

msgid "I might read that later..."
msgstr ""

msgid "That smell..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's as thick as..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And it tastes like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is! It's naturally occurring Slime potion!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a test"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's an apple tree"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shame it's not a banana tree, I don't like apples"
msgstr ""

msgid "There aren't any apples left"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like there are some apples in it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I need the shell of a Rampaging Master Tortoise, the staff from a Dark Summoner"
msgstr ""

msgid "The keepsake of a warrior who has previously defeated the dragon"
msgstr ""

msgid "And a spare shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Once I have all of those items I need to place them in the cauldron..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a book about occult magic"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is interesting:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The shell fragment of a Rampaging Master Tortoise"
msgstr ""

msgid "The staff of a Dark Summoner"
msgstr ""

msgid "If the dragon has been defeated in the past then one must also gather"
msgstr ""

msgid "The keepsake from a warrior that previously defeated it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Once the ingredients have been gathered, they must be placed in the cauldron..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, not again! I'm fed up of using that stupid cauldron!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've got the staff, but where do I find the shell or the keepsake?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've got the shell, but where do I find the staff or the keepsake?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've got the shell and the staff, but where do I find the keepsake?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's a lot of ingredients that I have no idea where to find..."
msgstr ""

msgid "A lot of books"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing of interest here though"
msgstr ""

msgid "Those creepers look different to the others"
msgstr ""

msgid "They also look very dangerous..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Push left or right to move the cursor"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Attack to change the colour of the peg"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you have selected all of the colours, move the cursor onto the question mark and press Attack"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number shown in the box is the number of pegs that are correctly placed"
msgstr ""

msgid "You have 10 attempts to guess the sequence"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Action to quit"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's not working at the moment"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I should come back later..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a giant mastermind puzzle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I used to play these all the time when we were travelling up to the big city"
msgstr ""

msgid "It doesn't look like it's working though"
msgstr ""

msgid "This looks like the horn that Olaf needs"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll have to break it off somehow..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What a hassle that was"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think I'll find my Dad in here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I should look somewhere else"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, there might be something in here worth my time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There, looks like the little guy is full and is sleeping it off"
msgstr ""

msgid "I should be able to get past him without any bother now"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a baby Hoover"
msgstr ""

msgid "I saw a grown up one in the big city when I went there with my Dad, they're completely harmless"
msgstr ""

msgid "I miss my Dad, I hope I find him soon..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why is it here? It must be frightened"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello little fella, are you lost?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Don't worry, I won't hurt you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ow!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I guess it's scared. I might be able to get past it if I give it some food"
msgstr ""

msgid "They're vegetarians so I'll have to find some fruit or vegetables..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully I'll never have to use this again"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll use my wooden shield..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not taking any chances this time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Did it work?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I think it's safe now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmm, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a small statue. It must be the one that Olaf said he stole"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, since he's helping me get back to the sorceror, the least I can do is retrieve it for him"
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, it might have just fallen further down into the cave, I'll just have to keep looking"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like there's a larger network of caves down there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Olaf did tell me to just get the horn and leave"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sorceror will almost certainly destroy me if I confront him without the shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'd better go and make it first"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, what a cool looking shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully this will protect me from that spell"
msgstr ""

msgid "But there's only one way to find out..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It worked, I'm back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to create that shield and get that sorceror..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a Resist Disintegration Shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "The horn from a fearsome monster"
msgstr ""

msgid "A delicious apple"
msgstr ""

msgid "A magical shell fragment from a Rampaging Master Tortoise"
msgstr ""

msgid "A shield that can resist disintegration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try using one of the artifacts to protect yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Failed to load game"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your %s has been destroyed"
msgstr ""

msgid "Binding only works against weakened demons"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not so clever now are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I REALLY have to get out of here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Persistent aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't know what you did last time, but trust me, you won't escape again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Phew)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Hey, look at that, one of the orbs on the shield has lit up...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, if you won't tell me the whereabouts of my father"
msgstr ""

msgid "I will have to beat it out of you"
msgstr ""

msgid "You will never get that chance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Grimlore, I summon you! Destroy this pest!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Farewell, Edgar"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something's coming..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This library must have information on everything, so a book detailing the creation of a Shield of Dragon Fire Resistance must be here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "That dragon stuff sounded interesting, but I'll read about it after I've created the Fire Shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "There, back to your own dimension"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where did the sorceror go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "This would have allowed you to fight Mataeus, but it looks like you've already defeated him..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a draft here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And one of these bricks is loose"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aha! It's a hidden passage!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully this will lead me to the sorceror..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Negotiate the Swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "The door won't open, I guess I put in the combination incorrectly"
msgstr ""

msgid "The soul of a wandering spirit"
msgstr ""

msgid "Escape the Cave"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm, maybe this scrap of paper is the combination"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll give it a try"
msgstr ""

msgid "Push left or right to move the dial 1 unit in that direction"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you think you've input the correct combination, press Attack to open the safe"
msgstr ""

msgid "Talk to Borgan"
msgstr ""

msgid "Talk to Jacob"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross the lake to the Swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm.. I've been all around the fortress and there are no other doors leading off anywhere"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I should have another look in here..."
