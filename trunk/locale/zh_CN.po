msgstr ""

msgid "What is all this stuff?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your experiment separated part of your conscious"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes I know that, you already told me"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm still talking!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There should only be one of us in this world: one body, one conscious"
msgstr ""

msgid "These machines will join us together"
msgstr ""

msgid "The one on the left is for the original body, you"
msgstr ""

msgid "And the one on the right is for the new body, me"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will go in the one on the left and I'll go in the one on the right"
msgstr ""

msgid "It will then merge your body into mine, leaving just me"
msgstr ""

msgid "Merge us together? Over my dead body!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That was the plan. Since you're alive though, you've saved me the bother of "
"having to drag your carcass all the way back here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now get in the machine!"
msgstr ""

msgid "A spanner"
msgstr ""

msgid "An exploding Gazer Eyeball. A dud?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatically brings you back to life once if you die"

msgid "Flaming Arrows"

msgstr ""

msgid "Solve the jigsaw puzzle"

msgid "Try luring something else into the Ant Lion's pit..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Those flames are incredibly hot. I'll be burnt to cinders if I try and walk "

msgstr ""

msgid "There must be a way to cool them down..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I've found a way to kill the Centurions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They will reform unless one of their parts falls into the slime or lava"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I managed to retrieve two of the puzzle pieces before I was caught and "

msgstr ""

msgid "If I can break out of here again I'll be sure to escape"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Otherwise I hope another unfortunate victim will find this information useful"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a skull here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like he didn't manage to get out..."
msgstr ""

msgid "If one of these sustains too much damage it will split once again"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These versions are completely harmless and in this state can be simply "
"stepped on"
msgstr ""

msgid "This might have come in handy when I was hunting for the Red Sludges"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, there might be something else in these books worth reading..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, we meet at last!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"My name is Edgar and I have spent the last [HOURS] hours trying to find you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fascinating. What do you want?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've come to rescue my father, tell me where he is!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your father? My dear child, I do not have the foggiest idea what you are "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But if he's anywhere, he'll be in my dungeon. Why don't you look there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've managed to escape from my cell and am trying to find a way out"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I found a door blocked by a frame which you need to put 9 jigsaw puzzle "
"pieces in"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The pieces are locked behind doors which seem to be linked to the Red "
"Centurions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Centurions appear to be indestructible however"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unless I can find a way to destroy them I will die down here"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll find a way to destroy them"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm so close to rescuing Dad now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Find 9 Puzzle Pieces"
msgstr ""

msgid "A jigsaw puzzle?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not really a fan of these"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I prefer the sliding puzzles, like the one I had to solve to get the "
"Lightning Sword"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, it looks like this is the only way out"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like I need 9 pieces to slot into the frame"
msgstr ""

msgid "The frame is empty"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hopefully the pieces I need are around somewhere, otherwise I'm going to die "
"down here"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I've got all the pieces, I just need to place them in the frame and solve "
"the puzzle"
msgstr ""

msgid "Push left, right, up or down to move the cursor"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Attack to select the current piece and move it around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Attack again to stop moving the current piece"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Action to quit the puzzle"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ugh, I'm getting really fed up of waking up in strange places with my eyes "
"spinning around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, I'm trapped!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be a way to get this door open"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, perhaps that button unlocks it"
msgstr ""

msgid "If only I could reach it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I thought I felt something. There's a draft here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is this what I think it is?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is! It's an Amulet of Resurrection!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Borgan has one of these, but it's been used up. He must have had a lucky "
"escape from something."
msgstr ""

msgid "This should make my quest a lot easier"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Amulet of Resurrection will restore all your health once when it drops "
"to 0"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, it will not save you from anything that causes instant death, such "
"as lava or certain boss attacks"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need all 9 puzzle pieces"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using an item you have picked up is simple"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try it with the bomb, but make sure you stand well back!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While you are in the inventory screen, the action is paused so you can take "
"your time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some items, such as health potions and weapons can be used in the inventory "
"screen, so there is no need to exit the inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "A piece of a puzzle"
msgstr ""

msgid "The glass looks very weak now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Press Escape to exit"
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "ESCAPEE LOCATED"
msgstr ""

msgid "TARGET IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS"
msgstr ""

msgid "COMMENCING DESTRUCTION OF TARGET"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So you're back? Well this time, only one of us is getting out of here alive!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, what a nice ring"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hang on a second, Maggie told me to always ask if someone had lost something "
"before taking it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "ANYONE LOST A RING?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "No one? Guess it's mine then!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm back in the Fortress, thank goodness for that"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But Dad wasn't in there, I looked everywhere and there was no sign of him"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sorceror must have done something else with him, I'll have to go back "
"and find out"
msgstr ""

msgid "A beautiful ring"
msgstr ""

msgid "Normal Arrow is required"
msgstr ""

msgid "Created %d Flaming Arrows"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press buttons to escape the snowball!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you managed to find the horn yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you found everything yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not yet, I'm still looking"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, I've found everything now"
msgstr ""

msgid "ARGHHHHH!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Another human, out here? How did you get out here?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I'm not sure, I think the sorceror sent me here, but he said he was going to "
"kill me"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm, what's that on your hand?"
msgstr ""

msgid "This? This is just a ring I found in his fortress"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It looks like a ring of protection, it must have saved you. Why were you in "
"his fortress?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He's kidnapped my Dad and I was there trying to save him"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, it looks like the ring's power is almost completely gone"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If he hits you with that spell again it will almost certainly kill you"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Something must have protected you from the spell. Were you wearing a pendant "
"or a ring?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I did find a ring in the fortress but it didn't seem to have any powers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It might have been a ring of protection. I imagine that the protection would "
"have been limited to a single use"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What you could do though is combine the ring and your shield together to "
"create a shield that will protect you from the spell"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have any experience mixing spells?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Kind of, but the last time I tried creating a shield the spell backfired "
"and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It created an evil version of yourself?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yeah, how did you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where I'm from it used to happen at least once a month"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why are you here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sorceror caught me looting his fortress and he banished me here"
msgstr ""

msgid "What did you steal?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It was a small golden statue, probably worth a lot of money"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I've been here for months now, but I've almost got all the ingredients I "
"need to teleport back home"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I just need one more thing, but it's in a cave to the west and I have no "
"weapons to protect myself"
msgstr ""

msgid "But now you're here you can help me retrieve it"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I haven't gotten all my stuff back yet. I think everything's here though"
msgstr ""

msgid "When I've found everything I'll come back"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do you need?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's the horn from a particular type of monster"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There should be plenty of bones littered around so you shouldn't have to "
"find one and kill it. Just get the horn and get out"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, my stock of logs is looking quite low, maybe you could get me some "
"more while you're out?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't even think about it, I'm fed up of chopping down trees and collecting "
"logs!"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, it was just a suggestion"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, you'll need this too"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dip your arrows into it to turn them into fire arrows, it will help you burn "
"down the vines blocking the entrance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, one last thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Seriously, just get the horn"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have I just sent a young boy to his death?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sorry, did you say something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh?! Oh no, I was just practising the teleportation incantation..."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, you escaped"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes I did, and my father wasn't there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe you just didn't look hard enough"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have another look"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe you should work on your spells"
msgstr ""

msgid "NOW TELL ME WHERE MY FATHER IS!"
msgstr ""

msgid "You annoying little brat"
msgstr ""

msgid "I wouldn't be surprised if your father has abandoned you"
msgstr ""

msgid "What?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll show you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That, was a mistake"
msgstr ""

msgid "Die"
msgstr ""

msgid "That was odd, he was supposed to explode"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where did he go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use left and right to move the dial 1 unit at a time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure you keep count of how many times you move the dial since no on-"
"screen notification is given"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you think you've entered the combination correctly, press Attack to try "
"and open the door"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's no way I'll be able to figure out the combination, I'll have to find "
"out what it is"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It looks too thick to break open, I'll have to open it using the combination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The lab probably has the roots, fat and bones so I don't need to worry about "
"those"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmm, I've looked everywhere and this appears to be everything"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I guess the other things must have been destroyed when the sorceror used "
"that spell"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to find out where I am and how I can get back"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I can..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This book is different to the rest"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can feel a powerful magic emanating from it"
msgstr ""

msgid "A powerful evil magic"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I should leave it alone"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, I could be wrong, maybe it's not evil magic..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What just happened?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I shouldn't go around touching books that give off an evil aura"
msgstr ""

msgid "And spend more time looking for my Dad"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll leave it alone, I'm not getting a good feeling from it"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To turn your normal arrows into flaming arrows, just use the flaming arrow "
"potion in the inventory screen"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To swap between firing normal arrows and flaming arrows, select the arrows "
"in the inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Retrieve horn"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ouch, my head..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, I've lost all my equipment!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of my stuff is over there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If those items are in this wasteland then perhaps everything else is too"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll have to try and retrieve as much as I can..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Retrieve items"
msgstr ""

msgid "A potion to create flaming arrows"
msgstr ""

msgid "An Armadillo Spike Ball. Scatters spikes when thrown"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try getting the Borer to grab a bomb..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examine the book?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Turn on the generator?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That monster encyclopedia said the dragon's breath incinerated everything, "
"but that warrior still managed to defeat it"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Maybe this book has information about creating a shield to resist dragon "
"breath"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shield of Dragon Fire Resistance"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creation of shields of dragon fire resistance require occult magics and very "
"little is known about their manufacture"
msgstr ""

msgid "Drat, that's all it says"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This library is huge though, there must be a book in this place that "
"describes the process"
msgstr ""

msgid "But I've looked everywhere, haven't I?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need to recover my missing items before I can leave"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That stuff looks dangerous, it'd probably eat through my armour in seconds"
msgstr ""

msgid "But I'll have to find a way across..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, those look familiar"
msgstr ""

msgid "They look like hypnotic spores"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Borgan told me that they can temporarily trick certain creatures into "

msgid "I sure do"
msgstr ""

msgid "So what happens now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can get out of here! Where do you want to go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Back to the fortress, I still need to rescue my Dad from the sorceror"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, remember what I told you about his disintegration spell?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I think so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the lab and combine that ring and your shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "How?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Throw the shield and ring into the cauldron along with some mandrake root, "

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "(Then again, he did steal it, and I nearly died trying to get it)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Give the statue to Olaf?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I found this in the cave, is it the statue you took?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes it is! Thanks for finding it!"

msgid "I should be able to sell this for a decent price at the market"

msgid "Ready to go?"

msgid "Return to the Fortress?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not yet, there's something else I need to do"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, let me know when you're ready"

msgid "What was that?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'd better get out of here and get back to the Fortress..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's available on iBooks and the Amazon Kindle"

msgid ""
"I'm not exactly sure what any of that means, but it sounds interesting"

msgid "I might read that later..."
msgstr ""

msgid "That smell..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's as thick as..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And it tastes like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is! It's naturally occurring Slime potion!"

msgstr ""

msgid "Oh no, not again! I'm fed up of using that stupid cauldron!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've got the staff, but where do I find the shell or the keepsake?"

msgid "I've got the shell, but where do I find the staff or the keepsake?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've got the shell and the staff, but where do I find the keepsake?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's a lot of ingredients that I have no idea where to find..."
msgstr ""

msgid "A lot of books"

msgid "Nothing of interest here though"

msgid ""
"I used to play these all the time when we were travelling up to the big city"
msgstr ""

msgid "It doesn't look like it's working though"

msgid "I'll have to break it off somehow..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What a hassle that was"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think I'll find my Dad in here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I should look somewhere else"
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, there might be something in here worth my time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There, looks like the little guy is full and is sleeping it off"

msgid "I should be able to get past him without any bother now"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a baby Hoover"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I saw a grown up one in the big city when I went there with my Dad, they're "

msgid "Hello little fella, are you lost?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Don't worry, I won't hurt you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ow!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I guess it's scared. I might be able to get past it if I give it some food"
msgstr ""

msgid "They're vegetarians so I'll have to find some fruit or vegetables..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully I'll never have to use this again"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll use my wooden shield..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not taking any chances this time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Did it work?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I think it's safe now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmm, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's a small statue. It must be the one that Olaf said he stole"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, since he's helping me get back to the sorceror, the least I can do is "
"retrieve it for him"
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, it might have just fallen further down into the cave, I'll just have "
"to keep looking"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like there's a larger network of caves down there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Olaf did tell me to just get the horn and leave"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sorceror will almost certainly destroy me if I confront him without the "

msgstr ""

msgid "I'd better go and make it first"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, what a cool looking shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully this will protect me from that spell"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I don't know what you did last time, but trust me, you won't escape again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Phew)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Hey, look at that, one of the orbs on the shield has lit up...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, if you won't tell me the whereabouts of my father"

"That dragon stuff sounded interesting, but I'll read about it after I've "

msgstr ""

msgid "There, back to your own dimension"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where did the sorceror go?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This would have allowed you to fight Mataeus, but it looks like you've "

msgstr ""

msgid "There's a draft here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And one of these bricks is loose"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aha! It's a hidden passage!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hopefully this will lead me to the sorceror..."
