msgid "If you run me an errand then you can have the shield"

msgid "Go to the mine and collect me some coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "But we have plenty of coal!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, but this is not any old coal, this coal is special, it burns hotter and lasts longer"
msgstr ""

msgid "I only need 10 pieces of the stuff, so it shouldn't take you very long"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure you put it in a bag, touching it for too long will be bad for your health"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have a bag?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No, you can probably find one in the mine though"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, I'll get the coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, take this pickaxe. You can use it to mine the coal and hack through any weaker walls you encounter"
msgstr ""

msgid "You'll also need this key to get into the mine"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you, Edgar, this coal is perfect! Hope the bats didn't scare you."
msgstr ""

msgid "The bats were the least of my worries..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Say, I heard that something happened in that mine a few years ago"
msgstr ""

msgid "Er, yeah, there was what you'd call an \"incident\", but that part of the mine was sealed up a long time ago"
msgstr ""

msgid "Right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, have my shield and have fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Just stay away from the Forbidden Swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Will do, can I hold on to your pickaxe for a while?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sure thing, just bring it back in one piece"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks, Borgan!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you managed to find the coal yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can pull some items around by pushing against them whilst holding down the Action button."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then pull it around until you let go of the Action button"
msgstr ""

msgid "This rock looks too strong for my Pick Axe. I'll have to use something else to get through..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Urgh, what happened?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like this wasn't such a good idea after all"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be way out of here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This must be the coal wants me to mine for him"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think my shield will protect me from those fireballs. I'll have to find get a stronger one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "You won't be able to do this bit in this version, check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Strange creature..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, what was that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You again?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sorcerer must have taken Dad to his castle. I'll have to rescue him from there."
msgstr ""

msgid "The only way to get to the castle is through the Forbidden Swamp to the East."
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a lake between the Village and the Swamp so I'll need a raft to get across."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll also need a sword and shield to defend myself. I can speak to and to get these though."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something is supposed to happen here, but it's not in this version so check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks for resucing my chickens, have you got me 2 logs from the forest yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Edgar! My chickens are back and these logs will do me fine"
msgstr ""

msgid "Take this sword, may it serve you well!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks for the logs, have you had any luck with the chickens?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll give you a sword if you get me 2 chopped logs from the forest and rescue at least 3 of my chickens"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello Edgar, what can I do for you today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have a sword I can borrow?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I do have a sword and you can have it if you do something for me first"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK... what do I have to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of my chickens have escaped from their pen and I would be very grateful if you can get them back for me"
msgstr ""

msgid "I have set up some traps near their pen, you can lure them to the traps using this chicken feed. I don't need them all, but at least 3 would be very helpful. I can get the rest myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not quite. Can you also get me some wood from the forest? 2 logs should be sufficient"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have an axe?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Erm... I left my axe in the forest somewhere. It should still be there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn't that forest dangerous?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not really, if anything gets in your way, just hit it with a weapon"
msgstr ""

msgid "Such as an axe?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, that would do the trick"
msgstr ""

msgid "..."
msgstr ""

msgid "But seriously, there's nothing in there that can really harm you. That problem was dealt with a long time ago..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, thanks Edgar, I only needed 3, but thanks for the additional help!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, Maggie made me this health potion but I don't need it so why don't you have it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Jacob"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, you caught them all, thanks alot!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, I have these for you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maggie made me this health potion but you can have it"
msgstr ""

msgid "And this is something very special"
msgstr ""

msgid "May this help you on your way to becoming a strong warrior"
msgstr ""

msgid "You saved me a lot of time. Maggie made me something else but since you have been so helpful, you can have it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maggie Hello Edgar"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hi Maggie"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maggie Oh Edgar, you're hurt! Let me heal your wounds"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Maggie!"
msgstr ""

msgid "said that a section of the mine was sealed up after an \"incident\""
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be something around here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drat, the drawbridge is up. There must be another entrance..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I could tunnel my way in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "These machines aren't working."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like a gem should fit in this hole, maybe I can find some replacements."
msgstr ""

msgid "A sequence will happen now to activate the lift down by the sewer entrance"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like it's tightly wedged in there. I can probably loosen it with the pickaxe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "To get to the Forbidden Swamp I'll need to build a raft."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can build the raft if I chop down enough trees from the forest"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need 6 Chopped Logs to build a raft"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not going to the swamp without a sword and shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aw, not again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This had better be the last time I have to do this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "That was easy! And I can always get back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh...."
msgstr ""

msgid "Guess I have no choice now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hang on Dad, I'm coming..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something is supposed to happen now, but it's not in this version. Check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've been trapped down here for what seems like an eternity"
msgstr ""

msgid "To get out of this place I need 3 Access Keys to work the lifts"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far I have only found 1"
msgstr ""

msgid "To make matters worse, I can only reach some switches with a carefully placed arrow"
msgstr ""

msgid "But spares aren't common and I have run out"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I don't find a way out of here soon, I fear I may starve"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I don't get out of here I'll suffer the same fate..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, what's this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here too"
msgstr ""

msgid "The potion is perfect! Quaffing it will turn a human into a creature for a small amount of time"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far I can only transmogrify myself into one creature but with a bit more time anything should be possible"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a tiny bit left, it should be safe to drink"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Urgh!! This is horrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "told me that Slimes can swim in water though, so maybe this will be useful..."
msgstr ""

msgid "When transformed into a Slime, you can move around as normal. You can also swim in the water and use up and down to move around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pushing up or jump will make you jump out of the water if you're near the surface"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep an eye on the timer at the bottom of the screen. When it reaches 0 you will automatically become human again"
msgstr ""

msgid "This place doesn't look so bad..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What was that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Uh Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phew, I'm glad to be out of there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to get through this swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, what's this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks pretty harmless, I'll try stepping on it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow! That was cool! This must be a mechanical teleporter."
msgstr ""

msgid "I wonder if it works both ways..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Horray!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not only is this going to save me a lot of walking, it's also loads of fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now try out your shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Block the pellets spat out by the plant and jump up to the next ledge"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some items in the game can be pushed and pulled"
msgstr ""

msgid "To push an item, simply walk into it"
msgstr ""

msgid "To pull an item, walk into while holding down Action"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then pull the item around until you let go of Action"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pull the box over the other side and use it to reach the ledge"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the last part of the tutorial and will teach you to block and attack enemies"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, you should equip the sword since it has more range and does more damage than the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press z to view your inventory, highlight the sword and press Attack (left ctrl) or Use Item (a)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press z again to close your inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Occasionally, slain enemies will drop health which will vanish after a few seconds, so pick it up quickly!"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a bat is getting to close to you, hold block and it will harmlessly bounce off you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now kill all of the bats in the area!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two types of door in the game. Manual doors and Automatic doors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual doors require keys to open them, Automatic doors require switches."
msgstr ""

msgid "To open a locked door that you have the key for, simply walk into it. There is no need to have the key selected in your inventory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open the door and continue to the right"
