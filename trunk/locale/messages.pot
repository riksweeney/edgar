msgid "Can I borrow your shield?"

msgid "Off to practice your fighting skills?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something like that"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you run me an errand then you can have the shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do I have to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the mine and collect me some coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "But we have plenty of coal!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, but this is not any old coal, this coal is special, it burns hotter and lasts longer"
msgstr ""

msgid "I only need 10 pieces of the stuff, so it shouldn't take you very long"
msgstr ""

msgid "Make sure you put it in a bag, touching it for too long will be bad for your health"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have a bag?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No, you can probably find one in the mine though"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, I'll get the coal"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, take this pickaxe. You can use it to mine the coal and hack through any weaker walls you encounter"
msgstr ""

msgid "You'll also need this key to get into the mine"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you, Edgar, this coal is perfect! Hope the bats didn't scare you."
msgstr ""

msgid "The bats were the least of my worries..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Say, I heard that something happened in that mine a few years ago"
msgstr ""

msgid "Er, yeah, there was what you'd call an \"incident\", but that part of the mine was sealed up a long time ago"
msgstr ""

msgid "Right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, have my shield and have fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Just stay away from the Forbidden Swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Will do, can I hold on to your pickaxe for a while?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sure thing, just bring it back in one piece"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks, Borgan!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you managed to find the coal yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can pull some items around by pushing against them whilst holding down the Action button."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then pull it around until you let go of the Action button"
msgstr ""

msgid "This rock looks too strong for my Pick Axe. I'll have to use something else to get through..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Urgh, what happened?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like this wasn't such a good idea after all"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be way out of here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "This must be the coal wants me to mine for him"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't think my shield will protect me from those fireballs. I'll have to find a stronger one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "You won't be able to do this bit in this version, check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Strange creature..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, what was that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You again?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something is supposed to happen here, but it's not in this version so check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks for resucing my chickens, have you got me 2 logs from the forest yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Edgar! My chickens are back and these logs will do me fine"
msgstr ""

msgid "Take this sword, may it serve you well!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thank you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks for the logs, have you had any luck with the chickens?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll give you a sword if you get me 2 chopped logs from the forest and rescue at least 3 of my chickens"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hello Edgar, what can I do for you today?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have a sword I can borrow?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I do have a sword and you can have it if you do something for me first"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK... what do I have to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of my chickens have escaped from their pen and I would be very grateful if you can get them back for me"
msgstr ""

msgid "I have set up some traps near their pen, you can lure them to the traps using this chicken feed. I don't need them all, but at least 3 would be very helpful. I can get the rest myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not quite. Can you also get me some wood from the forest? 2 logs should be sufficient"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have an axe?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Erm... I left my axe in the forest somewhere. It should still be there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Isn't that forest dangerous?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not really, if anything gets in your way, just hit it with a weapon"
msgstr ""

msgid "Such as an axe?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, that would do the trick"
msgstr ""

msgid "..."
msgstr ""

msgid "But seriously, there's nothing in there that can really harm you. That problem was dealt with a long time ago..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, thanks Edgar, I only needed 3, but thanks for the additional help!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, Maggie made me this health potion but I don't need it so why don't you have it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Jacob"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, you caught them all, thanks alot!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, I have these for you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maggie made me this health potion but you can have it"
msgstr ""

msgid "And this is something very special"
msgstr ""

msgid "May this help you on your way to becoming a strong warrior"
msgstr ""

msgid "You saved me a lot of time. Maggie made me something else but since you have been so helpful, you can have it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hi Maggie"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Maggie!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Borgan said that a section of the mine was sealed up after an \"incident\""
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be something around here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drat, the drawbridge is up. There must be another entrance..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe I could tunnel my way in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "These machines aren't working."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like a gem should fit in this hole, maybe I can find some replacements."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like it's tightly wedged in there. I can probably loosen it with the pickaxe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "To get to the Forbidden Swamp I'll need to build a raft."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can build the raft if I chop down enough trees from the forest"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need 6 Chopped Logs to build a raft"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm not going to the swamp without a sword and shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Aw, not again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This had better be the last time I have to do this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "That was easy! And I can always get back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh...."
msgstr ""

msgid "Guess I have no choice now."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hang on Dad, I'm coming..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something is supposed to happen now, but it's not in this version. Check back later!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've been trapped down here for what seems like an eternity"
msgstr ""

msgid "To get out of this place I need 3 Access Keys to work the lifts"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far I have only found 1"
msgstr ""

msgid "To make matters worse, I can only reach some switches with a carefully placed arrow"
msgstr ""

msgid "But spares aren't common and I have run out"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I don't find a way out of here soon, I fear I may starve"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I don't get out of here I'll suffer the same fate..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, what's this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here too"
msgstr ""

msgid "The potion is perfect! Quaffing it will turn a human into a creature for a small amount of time"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far I can only transmogrify myself into one creature but with a bit more time anything should be possible"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a tiny bit left, it should be safe to drink"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Urgh!! This is horrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Borgan told me that Slimes can swim in water though, so maybe this will be useful..."
msgstr ""

msgid "When transformed into a Slime, you can move around as normal. You can also swim in the water and use up and down to move around"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pushing up or jump will make you jump out of the water if you're near the surface"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep an eye on the timer at the bottom of the screen. When it reaches 0 you will automatically become human again"
msgstr ""

msgid "This place doesn't look so bad..."
msgstr ""

msgid "What was that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Uh Oh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Phew, I'm glad to be out of there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to get through this swamp"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, what's this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks pretty harmless, I'll try stepping on it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow! That was cool! This must be a mechanical teleporter."
msgstr ""

msgid "I wonder if it works both ways..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Horray!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not only is this going to save me a lot of walking, it's also loads of fun!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now try out your shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "Block the pellets spat out by the plant and jump up to the next ledge"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some items in the game can be pushed and pulled"
msgstr ""

msgid "To push an item, simply walk into it"
msgstr ""

msgid "To pull an item, walk into while holding down Action"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can then pull the item around until you let go of Action"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pull the box over the other side and use it to reach the ledge"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the last part of the tutorial and will teach you to block and attack enemies"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, you should equip the sword since it has more range and does more damage than the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press z to view your inventory, highlight the sword and press Attack (left ctrl) or Use Item (a)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Press z again to close your inventory"
msgstr ""

msgid "Occasionally, slain enemies will drop health which will vanish after a few seconds, so pick it up quickly!"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a bat is getting to close to you, hold block and it will harmlessly bounce off you"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now kill all of the bats in the area!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two types of door in the game. Manual doors and Automatic doors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual doors require keys to open them, Automatic doors require switches."
msgstr ""

msgid "To open a locked door that you have the key for, simply walk into it. There is no need to have the key selected in your inventory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open the door and continue to the right"
msgstr ""

msgid "Congratulations! Now you know the basics of playing you should try the main game"

msgstr ""

msgid "Note that in this tutorial, the default keys will be assumed"
msgstr ""

msgid "When you have finished configuring the keys, go right to the next Action Point"
msgstr ""

msgid "The pickaxe is one of many weapons you will encounter in the game"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use it as both a weapon and a tool"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pick up the pickaxe and continue to the next Action Point"
msgstr ""

msgid "Congratulations, you found a secret!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are many secrets in the main game so keep a look out for them"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's a hint to get you started"
msgstr ""

msgid "Although only requires you to catch 3 of his chickens, why not be nice to him and catch more? There are 10 wandering the map in all"
msgstr ""

msgid "The shield will protect you from most enemy attacks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some enemy attacks cannot be blocked"
msgstr ""

msgid "Environmental hazards, such as falling rocks, cannot be blocked"
msgstr ""

msgid "To block an attack, press and hold block (left alt)."
msgstr ""

msgid "You must be facing the attack to succesfully block it"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that you cannot move whilst blocking, but you can face the other way. You also cannot block in the air"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pick up the shield and continue to the right"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a weak wall, it can be smashed down using the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgid "To use the pickaxe, press Attack (left ctrl)"
msgstr ""

msgid "that not all weak walls can be destroyed using the pickaxe"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Shield of Fire Resistance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ingredients"
msgstr ""

msgid "One must gather the following"
msgstr ""

msgid "The root of a Mandrake"
msgstr ""

msgid "The fat of a Darsh (left to stand for 3 months)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Powered Condor bones"
msgstr ""

msgid "3 eyes of the Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "The freshly cut tentacle from a female Red Sludge"
msgstr ""

msgid "The shield to apply the enchantment"
msgstr ""

msgid "Blend the Gazer eyes and Sludge tentacle into a smooth liquid"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add the root, fat and bones into the cauldron and mix together with the blended Gazer eyes and Sludge tentacle"
msgstr ""

msgid "When the mixture turns bright blue, add the shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've seen most of these items in the lab so I don't need to worry about those"
msgstr ""

msgid "And the Gazers hang around in the basement so that's not a problem"
msgstr ""

msgid "What I do need to find is a Red Sludge, but I have no idea where to find one"
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't use my current shield in the experiment in case it backfires so I'll have to find another one"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There might be potions room or lab where I can find the roots, fat and bones so I don't need to worry about those"
msgstr ""

msgid "You must have the instruction card you wish to use highlighted in your inventory box"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, a laboratory!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I love watching Maggie make spells and potions, maybe I can make some of my own here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, I've never seen so many books in one place!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be information about every subject here, this could be useful..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm, the air feels charged, it reminds me of Maggie's house when she was making spells. I should be careful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh Edgar, you're hurt! Let me heal your wounds"
msgstr ""

msgid "I wonder what other monsters there are. I'll pick a page at random..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gazers are flying cycloptic creatures found in various places"
msgstr ""

msgid "Their single eye is usually closed and they rely on sonar for movement"
msgstr ""

msgid "They use their strong sense of smell to look out for predator and prey alike"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gazers attack (and defend themselves) by opening their eye which will dazzle anything looking at it"
msgstr ""

msgid "This attack is only effective however if the victim is facing the Gazer"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Gazer's eyeball contains magical properties and is a common ingredient in spell preparation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Centurion, Grey"
msgstr ""

msgid "Centurions are magically created creatures, usually dispatched as sentries or guards"
msgstr ""

msgid "Though slow moving, their massive size allows them to simply march through any defense"
msgstr ""

msgid "Instead of arms, many have huge pile drivers which they use to shake the ground and disorientate threats"
msgstr ""

msgid "While Grey Centurions will be used to guard outer perimeters, Red Centurions are known to exist and are used to protect areas of great importance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Splitter"
msgstr ""

msgid "Splitters are harmless monsters unless attacked."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upon sustaining too much damage they will split in two and attack their predator"
msgstr ""

msgid "If one of these sustains too much damage it will split once again and continue to attack"
