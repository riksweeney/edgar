msgid "Thanks, this is perfect!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have everything you need now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I sure do"
msgstr ""

msgid "So what happens now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can get out of here! Where do you want to go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Back to the fortress, I still need to rescue my Dad from the sorceror"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, remember what I told you about his disintegration spell?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I think so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Go to the lab and combine that ring and your shield"
msgstr ""

msgid "How?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Throw the shield and ring into the cauldron along with some mandrake root, "
"that should do it"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing will go wrong this time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "..."
msgstr "..."

msgid "(I have the statue that Olaf stole)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Perhaps I should return it to him, he is saving me after all)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Then again, he did steal it, and I nearly died trying to get it)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Give the statue to Olaf?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I found this in the cave, is it the statue you took?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes it is! Thanks for finding it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I should be able to sell this for a decent price at the market"
msgstr ""

msgid "(I think I'll keep it for myself)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ready to go?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return to the Fortress?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not yet, there's something else I need to do"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, let me know when you're ready"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you managed to find the horn yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you found everything yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not yet, I'm still looking"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, I've found everything now"
msgstr ""

msgid "ARGHHHHH!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Another human, out here? How did you get out here?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I'm not sure, I think the sorceror sent me here, but he said he was going to "
"kill me"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hmmm, what's that on your hand?"
msgstr ""

msgid "This? This is just a ring I found in his fortress"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It looks like a ring of protection, it must have saved you. Why were you in "
"his fortress?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He's kidnapped my Dad and I was there trying to save him"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, it looks like the ring's power is almost completely gone"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If he hits you with that spell again it will almost certainly kill you"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Something must have protected you from the spell. Were you wearing a pendant "
"or a ring?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I did find a ring in the fortress but it didn't seem to have any powers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It might have been a ring of protection. I imagine that the protection would "
"have been limited to a single use"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What you could do though is combine the ring and your shield together to "
"create a shield that will protect you from the spell"
msgstr ""

msgid "Do you have any experience mixing spells?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Kind of, but the last time I tried creating a shield the spell backfired "
"and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It created an evil version of yourself?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yeah, how did you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where I'm from it used to happen at least once a month"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why are you here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sorceror caught me looting his fortress and he banished me here"
msgstr ""

msgid "What did you steal?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It was a small golden statue, probably worth a lot of money"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I've been here for months now, but I've almost got all the ingredients I "
"need to teleport back home"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I just need one more thing, but it's in a cave to the west and I have no "
"weapons to protect myself"
msgstr ""

msgid "But now you're here you can help me retrieve it"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I haven't gotten all my stuff back yet. I think everything's here though"
msgstr ""

msgid "When I've found everything I'll come back"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do you need?"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's the horn from a particular type of monster"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There should be plenty of bones littered around so you shouldn't have to "
"find one and kill it. Just get the horn and get out"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's it?"
msgstr "To wszystko?"

msgid "Hmmm"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, my stock of logs is looking quite low, maybe you could get me some "
"more while you're out?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't even think about it, I'm fed up of chopping down trees and collecting "
"logs!"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, it was just a suggestion"
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, you'll need this too"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dip your arrows into it to turn them into fire arrows, it will help you burn "
"down the vines blocking the entrance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks!"
msgstr "Dzięki!"

msgid "Oh, one last thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't hang around in that cave, the monsters that live in there are like "
"nothing you'll have ever encountered before"
msgstr ""

msgid "Seriously, just get the horn"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK"
msgstr "OK"

msgid "Have I just sent a young boy to his death?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sorry, did you say something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh?! Oh no, I was just practising the teleportation incantation..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes, let's go"
msgstr ""

msgid "OK, here goes nothing, good luck finding your father"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks, Olaf"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This lift is not working. I won't be able to use it until I restore the power"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wow, a catapult!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The hinges look rusted though, I doubt it'll work until I get them fixed"
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like the pulley for the drawbridge"
msgstr ""

msgid "The mechanism seems to be locked tight"
msgstr ""

msgid "It doesn't look too sturdy though, perhaps I can simply smash it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oops..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe nobody heard that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, the drawbridge is down at any rate..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Those flames are incredibly hot. I'll be burnt to cinders if I try and walk "
"through them"
msgstr ""

msgid "There must be a way to cool them down..."
msgstr ""

msgid "The shield will protect you from most enemy attacks"
msgstr "Tarcza będzie cię chronić przed atakami większości wrogów"

msgid "Some enemy attacks cannot be blocked"
msgstr "Ataki niektórych wrogów nie mogą być zablokowane"

msgid "Environmental hazards, such as falling rocks, cannot be blocked"
msgstr ""
"Niebezpieczeństwa środowiskowe, takie jak osuwanie się kamieni, nie mogą być "
"zablokowane"

msgid "To block an attack, press and hold block ([INPUT_BLOCK])."
msgstr ""

msgid "You must be facing the attack to successfully block it"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you cannot move whilst blocking, but you can face the other way. "
"You also cannot block in the air"
msgstr ""
"Zauważ, że podczas bloku nie możesz się poruszać, ale możesz się obracać. "
"Nie możesz także blokować w powietrzu"

msgid "Pick up the shield and continue to the right"
msgstr "Podnieś tarczę i idź dalej na prawo"

msgid "It's a portrait"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Something is supposed to happen here, but it's not in this version so check "
"back later!"
msgstr ""
"Coś powinno się tu wydarzyć, ale nie w tej wersji więc sprawdź kiedy indziej!"

msgid "Got it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What a ridiculous amount of effort to go through just to get a statue..."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'd better get out of here and get back to the Fortress..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Drat, the drawbridge is up. There must be another entrance..."
msgstr ""
"A niech to, ten zwodzony most jest podniesiony. Musi istnieć jakieś inne "
"wejście..."

msgid "Wait, what's that?"
msgstr "Czekaj, co to jest?"

msgid "Maybe I could tunnel my way in..."
msgstr "Może mogę wykopać tunel do środka..."

msgid "Gross..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Oh, what's this?"
msgstr "Oh, co to jest?"

msgid "It's a book by Stephen J Sweeney called \"The Honour of the Knights\""
msgstr ""

msgid "It's available on iBooks and the Amazon Kindle"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I'm not exactly sure what any of that means, but it sounds interesting"
msgstr ""

msgid "I might read that later..."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, you escaped"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes I did, and my father wasn't there"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe you just didn't look hard enough"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have another look"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe you should work on your spells"
msgstr ""

msgid "NOW TELL ME WHERE MY FATHER IS!"
msgstr ""

msgid "You annoying little brat"
msgstr ""

msgid "I wouldn't be surprised if your father has abandoned you"
msgstr ""

msgid "What?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll show you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That, was a mistake"
msgstr ""

msgid "Die"
msgstr ""

msgid "That was odd, he was supposed to explode"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where did he go?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's it? Just this old shield? It doesn't look any better than my current "
"one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Still, I'll hold onto it for the time being, it might come in handy"
msgstr ""

msgid "Great, a spare shield!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I have everything I need now"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a cauldron in the Laboratory, I should head back there"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This doesn't look like a Fire Shield to me. I was really hoping to find one "
"here too"
msgstr ""

msgid "This shield doesn't even look any better than my current one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I just need to create the liquid from the Sludge tentacle and Gazer eyeballs"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's not a good sign..."
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a note here"
msgstr "Jest tu jakaś wiadomość"

msgid "I've found a way to kill the Centurions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They will reform unless one of their parts falls into the slime or lava"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I managed to retrieve two of the puzzle pieces before I was caught and "
"locked in here again"
msgstr ""

msgid "If I can break out of here again I'll be sure to escape"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Otherwise I hope another unfortunate victim will find this information useful"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's a skull here"
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like he didn't manage to get out..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Leave now if you wish to live"
msgstr ""

msgid "Go back now"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you proceed, I will fight you and destroy you. Flee now, while you can"
msgstr ""

msgid "You fool. Do you truly seek destruction?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then I shall destroy you!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Congratulations, you found a secret!"
msgstr "Gratulacje, odkryłeś sekret!"

msgid "There are many secrets in the main game so keep a look out for them"
msgstr "W głównej grze jest wiele sekretów, więc wypatruj ich uważnie"

msgid "Here's a hint to get you started"
msgstr "Oto wskazówka na dobry początek"

msgid ""
"Although Jacob only requires you to catch 3 of his chickens, why not be nice "
"to him and catch more? There are 10 wandering the map in all"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can pull some items around by pushing against them whilst holding down "
"the Action button."
msgstr ""
"Możesz przeciągać przedmioty napierając na nie wciskając jednocześnie "
"klawisz akcji."

msgid "You can then pull it around until you let go of the Action button"
msgstr "Możesz i potem ciągnąć dopóki nie zwolnisz klawisza akcji"

msgid ""
"Whatever that thing was it was draining the power from that generator and "
"using it against me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That might explain why that lift wasn't working. Defeating the other "
"drainers should restore the power here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeat all Energy Drainers"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use left and right to move the dial 1 unit at a time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure you keep count of how many times you move the dial since no on-"
"screen notification is given"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you think you've entered the combination correctly, press Attack to try "
"and open the door"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There's no way I'll be able to figure out the combination, I'll have to find "
"out what it is"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep practising!"
msgstr "Nie przestawaj ćwiczyć!"

msgid "Hi"
msgstr "Cześć"

msgid "Hello Edgar"
msgstr "Witaj Edgarze"

msgid "Can I borrow your shield?"
msgstr "Mogę pożyczyć twoją tarczę?"

msgid "Off to practice your fighting skills?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something like that"
msgstr "Coś w tym stylu"

msgid "If you run me an errand then you can have the shield"
msgstr "Jeśli wykonasz dla mnie zadanie to dostaniesz tarczę"

msgid "What do I have to do?"
msgstr "Co masz do roboty?"

msgid "Go to the mine and collect me some coal"
msgstr "Udaj się do kopalni i przynieś mi trochę węgla"

msgid "But we have plenty of coal!"
msgstr "Ale przecież mamy pełno węgla!"

msgid ""
"Yes, but this is not any old coal, this coal is special, it burns hotter and "
"lasts longer"
msgstr ""
"Tak, ale to nie jest stary węgiel, ten węgiel jest specjalny, bardziej się "
"rozgrzewa i starcza na dłużej"

msgid ""
"I only need 10 pieces of the stuff, so it shouldn't take you very long"
msgstr ""
"Potrzebuję tylko 10 kawałków, więc nie powinno zająć ci to wiele czasu"

msgid ""
"Make sure you put it in a bag, touching it for too long will be bad for your "
"health"
msgstr ""
"Upewnij się, że włożyłeś go do torby. Dotykanie go przez długi czas odbije "
"się na twoim zdrowiu"

msgid "Do you have a bag?"
msgstr "Masz torbę?"

msgid "No, you can probably find one in the mine though"
msgstr "Nie, prawdopodobnie znajdziesz jakąś w kopalni"

msgid "OK, I'll get the coal"
msgstr "W porządku, wezmę węgiel"

msgid ""
"Here, take this pickaxe. You can use it to mine the coal and hack through "
"any weaker walls you encounter"
msgstr ""
"Masz, weź ten kilof. Możesz go wykorzystać do wykopania węgla oraz do "
"przebicia słabszych ścian skalnych, które napotkasz"

msgid "You'll also need this key to get into the mine"
msgstr "Będziesz także potrzebował tego klucza aby dostać się do kopalni"

msgid "Collect 10 pieces of Coal"
msgstr "Zbierz 10 kawałków Węgla"

msgid ""
"Thank you, Edgar, this coal is perfect! Hope the bats didn't scare you."
msgstr ""
"Dziękuję ci, Edgar. Ten węgiel jest doskonały! Mam nadzieję, że nietoperze "
"nie napędziły ci strachu."

msgid "The bats were the least of my worries..."
msgstr "Nietoprze były najmniejszym moim zmartwieniem..."

msgid "Say, I heard that something happened in that mine a few years ago"
msgstr "Słyszałem, że coś się wydarzyło w tej kopalni kilka lat temu"

msgid ""
"Er, yeah, there was what you'd call an \"incident\", but that part of the "
"mine was sealed up a long time ago"
msgstr ""
"Eeee, no tak, można to nazwać swego rodzaju \"wypadkiem\", ale ta część "
"kopalni została zapieczontowana dawno temu"

msgid "Right..."
msgstr "Słusznie..."

msgid "Here, have my shield and have fun!"
msgstr "Proszę, weź tą tarczę i baw się dobrze!"

msgid "Just stay away from the Forbidden Swamp"
msgstr "Poprostu trzymaj się z daleka od Zakazanego Bagna"

msgid "Will do, can I hold on to your pickaxe for a while?"
msgstr "Tak zrobię. Czy mogę pożyczyć twój kilof na jakiś czas?"

msgid "Sure thing, just bring it back in one piece"
msgstr "Pewnie, tylko zwróć go w jednym kawałku"

msgid "Thanks, Borgan!"
msgstr "Dzięki, Borgan!"

msgid "Have you managed to find the coal yet?"
msgstr "Czy udało ci się znaleźć węgiel?"

msgid "A safe in a library? Bit of a cliché..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It looks too thick to break open, I'll have to open it using the combination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You must have the statue you wish to use highlighted in your inventory box"
msgstr ""

msgid "Huh, what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "ESCAPEE LOCATED"
msgstr ""

msgid "TARGET IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS"
msgstr ""

msgid "COMMENCING DESTRUCTION OF TARGET"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need a blank card to put the instructions on"
msgstr ""

msgid "That smell..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It looks like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's as thick as..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And it tastes like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is! It's naturally occurring Slime potion!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Gotcha!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Not so clever now are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I REALLY have to get out of here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hi Maggie"
msgstr "Cześć Maggie"

msgid "Oh Edgar, you're hurt! Let me heal your wounds"
msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks Maggie!"
msgstr "Dziękuję Maggie!"

msgid "Persistent aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I don't know what you did last time, but trust me, you won't escape again!"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Phew)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Hey, look at that, one of the orbs on the shield has lit up...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your spell won't work against me any more"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, if you won't tell me the whereabouts of my father"
msgstr ""

msgid "I will have to beat it out of you"
msgstr ""

msgid "You will never get that chance"
msgstr ""

msgid "Grimlore, I summon you! Destroy this pest!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Farewell, Edgar"
msgstr ""

msgid "Something's coming..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That spirit isn't going to let me past, I'll have to find a way to get rid "
"of it"
msgstr ""

msgid "This place doesn't look so bad..."
msgstr "To miejsce nie wygląda tak źle..."

msgid "What was that?"
msgstr "Co to było?"

msgid "Uh Oh..."
msgstr "Uh Oh..."

msgid ""
"There are two types of door in the game. Manual doors and Automatic doors."
msgstr "W grze są dwa typy drzwi. Drzwi Ręczne i Automatyczne."

msgid ""
"Manual doors require keys to open them, Automatic doors require switches."
msgstr ""
"Drzwi Ręczne potrzebują klucza, aby je otworzyć, Automatyczne potrzebują "
"dźwigni."

msgid ""
"To open a locked door that you have the key for, simply walk into it. There "
"is no need to have the key selected in your inventory."
msgstr ""
"Aby otworzyć zamknięte drzwi, do których posiadasz klucz, poprostu wejdź w "
"nie. Nie musisz wybierać klucza ze swojego ekwipunku."

msgid "Open the door and continue to the right"
msgstr "Otwórz drzwi i idź dalej w prawo"

msgid "Urgh, what happened?"
msgstr "Uhhh, co się stało?"

msgid "Where am I?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now try out your shield"
msgstr "Teraz wypróbuj swoją tarczę"

msgid "Block the pellets spat out by the plant and jump up to the next ledge"
msgstr "Zablokuj palety wypuszczone przez roślinę i wskocz na następną półkę"

msgid "I can't believe he's gone"
msgstr ""

msgid "I tried so hard to find him"
msgstr ""

msgid "And I failed"
msgstr ""

msgid "What am I going to do now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "*sniff*"
msgstr ""

msgid "Edgar! Edgar, where are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "!"
msgstr "!"

msgid "That voice..."
msgstr ""

msgid "It can't be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Daddy!"
msgstr "Tatuś!"

msgid "Edgar!"
msgstr "Edgar!"

msgid "Jacob, I found him!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What are you doing here, son? It's dangerous, we have to leave"
msgstr ""

msgid "I came to rescue you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eh? What are you... No, tell me later, let's go home"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll try again"
msgstr ""

msgid "Give up?"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll figure this out another time"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll keep trying"
msgstr ""

msgid "This music sheet might be his anthem, I'll give it a go"
msgstr ""

msgid "I need to find out what Ivan's anthem is"
msgstr ""

msgid "Randomly ringing bells isn't going to work..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something is etched on this door"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enshrined in this tomb is the great warrior Ivan"
msgstr ""

msgid "Defeater of the evil dragon known as Chaos"
msgstr ""

msgid "Access to his tomb is granted only to those who play his anthem"
msgstr ""

msgid "His anthem? How on earth am I going to figure that out?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "This entire section is about monsters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I don't have any reason to read these but I'll keep it in mind in case I do"
msgstr ""

msgid "I wonder what other monsters there are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Chaos"
msgstr "Chaos"

msgid "Chaos is an ancient, evil dragon"
msgstr ""

msgid "A dragon?! Dad told me they were all extinct!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For years he wreaked havoc across this land and took thousands of innocent "
"lives, his fiery breath incinerated everything in its path"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally a brave warrior and a group of magicians managed to overwhelm and "
"bind him"
msgstr ""

msgid "They sealed the dragon away beneath an old fortress"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is believed he is still there"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Slowly regaining his power until he is strong enough to break free and "
"terrorise the world once again"
msgstr ""

msgid "Beneath an old fortress? Maybe they mean this one..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If that drgaon is regaining its power then it must be stopped before it's "
"too late"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But if its breath destroys anything then I won't be able to protect myself"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unless..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Grimlore"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Grimlore is a creature from another dimension. It can be summoned using "
"powerful dark magic"
msgstr ""

msgid "The most common reason to summon this beast is to act as a bodyguard"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no known way to kill Grimlore since upon sustaining critical "
"injuries it will simply return to its own dimension"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But even injuring it is a monumental task. Anyone encountering this creature "
"is advised to escape as quickly as possible"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or they will die very quickly"
msgstr ""

msgid "Summoner, Dark"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just like regular Summoners, Dark Summoners call in other beasts to do their "
"bidding"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally though they can teleport short distances to escape from their "
"opponents"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Their staff is highly magical and although it cannot be used by humans "
"directly, its magical properties are used in spell creation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hoover, Pink"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pink Hoovers are small quadrupeds with a long snout"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The primary purpose of the snout is to forage for food but it also serves as "
"a defence mechanism"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"and are more than capable of keeping a predator at bay by simply blowing "
"them away"
msgstr ""

msgid "Venus Flytrap, mobile"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mobile Venus Flytraps have evolved roots and are able to move to their food "
"rather than waiting for it to come to them"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Their necks are incredibly elastic and are able to snap at their prey from a "
"considerable distance away"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tortoise, Master"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Master Tortoises are frightening beasts. Found in far away lands they "
"possess the ability to change their heads"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They combine all the abilities of their cousins to breathe fire, create ice "
"and electrify themselves"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And of course they are also impervious to attacks from matching elements, "
"absorbing the energy to heal themselves"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But additionally, if they receive too much energy from healing, they evolve "
"and go on the rampage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this state they will smash through any defence and produce Dark Matter "
"which destroys anything it touches"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, the shell of a rampaging Master Tortoise is highly magical and is "
"an essential ingredient when creating powerful magics and items"
msgstr ""

msgid "Grub, Red"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Red Grubs are more aggressive than their green counterparts and will attack "
"anything they view as a threat"
msgstr ""

msgid "Upon reaching maturity they will form a cocoon and morph into a wasp"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some however will morph into a queen wasp. These queens can produce a mucus-"

msgid "Maybe I shouldn't go around touching books that give off an evil aura"
