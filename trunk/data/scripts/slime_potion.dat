TALK Edgar There's a note here too
TALK Note The potion is perfect! Quaffing it will turn a human into a creature for a small amount of time
TALK Note So far I can only transmogrify myself into one creature but with a bit more time anything should be possible
TALK Edgar There's a tiny bit left, it should be safe to drink
TALK Edgar OK, here goes nothing...

TALK Edgar Urgh!! This is horrible!
TALK Edgar Borgan told me that Slimes can swim in water though, so maybe this will be useful...
TALK Narrator When transformed into a Slime, you can move around as normal. You can also swim in the water and use up and down to move around
TALK Narrator Pushing up or jump will make you jump out of the water if you're near the surface
TALK Narrator Keep an eye on the timer at the bottom of the screen. When it reaches 0 you will automatically become human again
