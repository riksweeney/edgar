TALK Edgar There's a note here
TALK Note I've been trapped down here for what seems like an eternity
TALK Note To get out of this place I need 3 Access Keys to work the lifts
TALK Note So far I have only found 1
TALK Note To make matters worse, I can only reach some switches with a carefully placed arrow
TALK Note But spares aren't common and I have run out
TALK Note If I don't find a way out of here soon, I fear I may starve
SET Edgar FACE RIGHT
TALK Edgar If I don't get out of here I'll suffer the same fate...
