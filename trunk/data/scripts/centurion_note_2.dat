TALK Edgar There's a note here
TALK Note I've found a way to kill the Centurions
TALK Note They will reform unless one of their parts falls into the slime or lava
TALK Note I managed to retrieve two of the pieces before I was caught and locked in here again
TALK Note If I can break out of here again I'll be sure to escape
TALK Note Otherwise I hope another unfortunate victim will find this information useful
TALK Edgar There's a skull here
TALK Edgar Looks like he didn't manage to get out...
