TALK Edgar Hi
TALK Borson Hello Edgar
TALK Edgar Can I borrow your shield?
TALK Borson Off to practice your fighting skills?
TALK Edgar Something like that
TALK Borson If you run me an errand then you can have the shield
TALK Edgar What do I have to do?
TALK Borson Go to the mine and collect me some coal
TALK Edgar But we have plenty of coal!
TALK Borson Yes, but this is not any old coal, this coal is special, it burns hotter and lasts longer
TALK Borson I only need 10 pieces of the stuff, so it shouldn't take you very long
TALK Borson Make sure you put it in a bag, touching it for too long will be bad for your health
TALK Edgar Do you have a bag?
TALK Borson No, you can probably find one in the mine though
TALK Edgar OK, I'll get the coal
ADD ENTITY WEAPON weapon/pickaxe " " 1900 50
TALK Borson Here, take this pickaxe. You can use it to mine the coal and hack through any weaker walls you encounter
ADD ENTITY ITEM item/iron_key "Mine Entrance Door Key" 2000 50
TALK Borson You'll also need this key to get into the mine
TALK Edgar Thanks!
