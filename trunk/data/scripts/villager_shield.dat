TALK Edgar Hi
TALK Borgan Hello Edgar
TALK Edgar Can I borrow your shield?
TALK Borgan Off to practice your fighting skills?
TALK Edgar Something like that
TALK Borgan If you run me an errand then you can have the shield
TALK Edgar What do I have to do?
TALK Borgan Go to the mine and collect me some coal
TALK Edgar But we have plenty of coal!
TALK Borgan Yes, but this is not any old coal, this coal is special, it burns hotter and lasts longer
TALK Borgan I only need 10 pieces of the stuff, so it shouldn't take you very long
TALK Borgan Make sure you put it in a bag, touching it for too long will be bad for your health
TALK Edgar Do you have a bag?
TALK Borgan No, you can probably find one in the mine though
TALK Edgar OK, I'll get the coal
ADD ENTITY WEAPON weapon/pickaxe " " 280 3000

ADD ENTITY ITEM item/iron_key "Mine Entrance Door Key" 340 3000
TALK Borgan You'll also need this key to get into the mine
TALK Edgar Thanks!
