TALK Narrator This is the last part of the tutorial and will teach you to block and attack enemies
TALK Narrator First, you should equip the sword since it has more range and does more damage than the pickaxe
TALK Narrator Press [INPUT_INVENTORY] to view your inventory, highlight the sword and press Attack ([INPUT_ATTACK]) or Use Item ([INPUT_ACTIVATE])
TALK Narrator Press [INPUT_INVENTORY] again to close your inventory
TALK Narrator Occasionally, slain enemies will drop health which will vanish after a few seconds, so pick it up quickly!
