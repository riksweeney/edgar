TALK Edgar I need to find 3 Gazer Eyes, 1 Red Sludge Tentacle and an extra shield to create a Shield of Fire Resistance
TALK Edgar Once I've found all these items I'll have to find a place to create the shield

TALK Book Shield of Dragon Fire Resistance
TALK Book Creation of shields of dragon fire resistance require occult magics and very little is known about their manufacture
TALK Book Known ingredients include the shell fragment from a Rampaging Master Tortoise and the staff of a Dark Summoner
TALK Edgar Drat, that's all it says
TALK Edgar This library is huge though, there must be a book in this place that describes the process
TALK Edgar But I've looked everywhere, haven't I?

IF HAS_NOT_VISITED map10
TALK Edgar There might be potions room or lab where I can find the roots, fat and bones so I don't need to worry about those

TALK Edgar The lab probably has the roots, fat and bones so I don't need to worry about those

TALK Edgar What I do need to find is a Red Sludge, but I have no idea where to find one
TALK Edgar I can't use my current shield in the experiment in case it backfires so I'll have to find another one
