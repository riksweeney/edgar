TALK Edgar The sorceror must have taken Dad to his castle. I'll have to rescue him from there.
TALK Edgar The only way to get to the castle is through the Forbidden Swamp to the East.
TALK Edgar There's a lake between the Village and the Swamp so I'll need a raft to get across.
TALK Edgar I'll also need a sword and shield to defend myself. I can speak to Borgan and Jacob to get these though.
