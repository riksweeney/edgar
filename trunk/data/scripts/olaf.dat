TALK Olaf Thanks, this is perfect!
TALK Edgar Do you have everything you need now?
TALK Olaf I sure do
TALK Edgar So what happens now?
TALK Olaf We can get out of here! Where do you want to go?
TALK Edgar Back to the fortress, I still need to rescue my Dad from the sorceror
TALK Olaf OK, remember what I told you about his disintegration spell?
TALK Edgar I think so...
TALK Olaf Go to the lab and combine that ring and your shield
TALK Edgar How?
TALK Olaf Throw the shield and ring into the cauldron along with some mandrake root, that should do it
TALK Edgar OK...
TALK Olaf Nothing will go wrong this time!

IF OLAF HEALTH 1
TALK Olaf Hmmm, what's that on your hand?
TALK Edgar This? This is just a ring I found in his fortress
TALK Olaf It looks like a ring of protection, it must have saved you. Why were you in his fortress?
TALK Edgar He's kidnapped my Dad and I was there trying to save him
TALK Olaf Well, it looks like the ring's power is almost completely gone
TALK Olaf If he hits you with that spell again it will almost certainly kill you
END
IF OLAF HEALTH 2
TALK Olaf Something must have protected you from the spell. Were you wearing a pendant or a ring?
TALK Edgar I did find a ring in the fortress but it didn't seem to have any powers
TALK Olaf It might have been a ring of protection. I imagine that the protection would have been limited to a single use
TALK Olaf If he hits you with that spell again it will almost certainly kill you
END
TALK Olaf What you could do though is combine the ring and your shield together to create a shield that will protect you from the spell
TALK Olaf Do you have any experience mixing spells?
TALK Edgar Kind of, but the last time I tried creating a shield the spell backfired and...
TALK Olaf It created an evil version of yourself?
TALK Edgar Yeah, how did you know?
TALK Olaf Where I'm from it used to happen at least once a month
TALK Edgar ...
TALK Edgar Why are you here?
TALK Olaf The sorceror caught me looting his fortress and he banished me here
TALK Edgar What did you steal?
TALK Olaf It was a small golden statue, probably worth a lot of money
TALK Olaf I've been here for months now, but I've almost got all the ingredients I need to teleport back home
TALK Olaf I just need one more thing, but it's in a cave to the west and I have no weapons to protect myself
TALK Olaf But now you're here you can help me retrieve it
