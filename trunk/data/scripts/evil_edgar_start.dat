#TALK Edgar What is all this stuff?
#TALK Evil_Edgar Your experiment separated part of your conscious
#TALK Edgar Yes I know that, you already told me
#TALK Evil_Edgar I'm still talking!
#TALK Edgar ...
#TALK Evil_Edgar There should only be one of us in this world: one body, one conscious
#TALK Evil_Edgar These machines will join us together
#TALK Evil_Edgar The one on the left is for the original body, you
#TALK Evil_Edgar And the one on the right is for the new body, me
#TALK Evil_Edgar You will go in the one on the left and I'll go in the one on the right
#TALK Evil_Edgar It will then merge your body into mine, leaving just me
#TALK Edgar Merge us together? Over my dead body!
#TALK Evil_Edgar That was the plan. Since you're alive though, you've saved me the bother of having to drag your carcass all the way back here
#TALK Evil_Edgar Now get in the machine!
#TALK Edgar Make me!
#TALK Evil_Edgar Fine, I will!
