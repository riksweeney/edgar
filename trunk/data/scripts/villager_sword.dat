TALK Villager Hello Edgar, what can I do for you today?
TALK Edgar Do you have a sword I can borrow?
TALK Villager I do have a sword and I you can have it if you do something for me first
TALK Edgar OK... what do I have to do?
TALK Villager Some of my chickens have escaped from their pen and I would be very grateful if you can get them back for me
TALK Villager You can lure them back to the pen by using this chicken feed
TALK Edgar That's it?
TALK Villager Not quite. Can you also get me some wood from the forest? 2 logs should be sufficient
TALK Edgar Do you have an axe?
TALK Villager Erm... I left my axe in the forest somewhere. It should still be there
TALK Edgar Isn't that forest dangerous?
TALK Villager Not really, if anything gets in your way, just hit it with a weapon
TALK Edgar Such as an axe?
TALK Villager Yes, that would do the trick
TALK Edgar ...
TALK Villager But seriously, there's nothing in there that can really harm you. That problem was dealt with a long time ago...
TALK Villager Good luck!
