TALK Jacob Hello Edgar, what can I do for you today?
TALK Edgar Do you have a sword I can borrow?
TALK Jacob I do have a sword and you can have it if you do something for me first
TALK Edgar OK... what do I have to do?
TALK Jacob Some of my chickens have escaped from their pen and I would be very grateful if you can get them back for me
ADD ENTITY KEY_ITEM item/chicken_feed_bag " " 4030 2582
TALK Jacob I have set up some traps near their pen, you can lure them to the traps using this chicken feed
TALK Edgar That's it?
TALK Jacob Not quite. Can you also get me some wood from the forest? 2 logs should be sufficient
TALK Edgar Do you have an axe?
TALK Jacob Erm... I left my axe in the forest somewhere. It should still be there
TALK Edgar Isn't that forest dangerous?
TALK Jacob Not really, if anything gets in your way, just hit it with a weapon
TALK Edgar Such as an axe?
TALK Jacob Yes, that would do the trick
TALK Edgar ...
TALK Jacob But seriously, there's nothing in there that can really harm you. That problem was dealt with a long time ago...
TALK Jacob Good luck!
